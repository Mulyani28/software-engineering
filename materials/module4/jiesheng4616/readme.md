# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Mobile App for Fitness Tracking


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a mobile app that allows users to track their fitness progress, set goals, and view workout recommendations. The app will be available for both iOS and Android devices.

## Scope
The fitness tracking app will include the following features:

- User registration and profile creation
- Fitness tracking for a variety of activities such as running, cycling, and weightlifting
- Goal setting and progress tracking for both short-term and long-term fitness goals
- Workout recommendations based on user preferences and fitness level
- Integration with wearable devices such as fitness trackers and heart rate monitors
- Social features for sharing progress with friends and other users
- In-app purchases for premium features such as personalized workout plans

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders for this project include:
- The development team, who will be responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the app
- The end-users, who will be using the app to track their fitness progress and achieve their goals
- The marketing team, who will be responsible for promoting the app and acquiring new users

## Use Cases
The following use cases have been identified for the fitness tracking app:
- Creating a new user profile and setting fitness goals
- Tracking a workout and recording progress
- Receiving workout recommendations based on fitness level and preferences
- Sharing progress with friends and other users
- Purchasing premium features such as personalized workout plans

## Functional Requirements
The fitness tracking app must include the following features:
- A user-friendly interface for tracking workouts and setting goals
- Integration with wearable devices such as fitness trackers and heart rate monitors
- Personalized workout recommendations based on user preferences and fitness level
- Social features for sharing progress with friends and other users
- In-app purchases for premium features such as personalized workout plans

## Non-functional Requirements
The fitness tracking app must meet the following non-functional requirements:
- High availability and reliability, with minimal downtime
- Fast response times for user interactions
- Secure storage and transmission of user data
- Compatibility with both iOS and Android devices

## Assumptions and Constraints
Assumptions:
- Users have basic knowledge of fitness and exercise
- The app will be developed using React Native framework
- The app will be released in English language only

## Constraints:

- The project must be completed within a 6-month timeframe
- The development team is limited to 4 developers

## Risks
Potential risks for the project include:
- Technical challenges related to integrating with wearable devices
- Difficulty in designing a user-friendly interface for tracking workouts and setting goals
- Competition from other fitness tracking apps in the market
- Mitigation strategies include regular communication with stakeholders, testing and debugging throughout development, and market research to understand the competition.

## Glossary
Fitness tracking - the process of monitoring physical activity, such as workouts and daily steps, to track progress towards fitness goals
Wearable device - a device worn on the body, such as a fitness tracker or smartwatch, that monitors physical activity and other biometric data.

## Requirement Engineering Process
Here are the key steps in the requirement engineering process for a mobile app for fitness tracking:

- Elicitation: Identify the requirements for the app by talking to stakeholders such as end-users, marketing teams, and development teams. Use techniques such as interviews, surveys, and brainstorming sessions to gather information about what features and functionalities are desired in the app.

- Analysis: Analyze the requirements to identify any conflicts or inconsistencies. Consider how the requirements will impact other parts of the app, such as the user interface, performance, and security. Use modeling techniques such as use cases, user stories, and flowcharts to document the requirements.

- Specification: Define the requirements in detail, using a standardized format such as a software requirements specification document. Include both functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, usability, and security.

- Validation: Review and validate the requirements to ensure that they meet the needs of stakeholders and are feasible to implement. Use techniques such as peer review, walkthroughs, and prototyping to validate the requirements.

- Management: Manage the requirements throughout the software development life cycle. Monitor changes to the requirements and ensure that they are properly documented and communicated to stakeholders. Use tools such as requirement management software to track the status of the requirements.

- Traceability: Establish traceability between the requirements and other parts of the app, such as the design, code, and testing. Use tools such as traceability matrices to track the relationships between the requirements and other parts of the app.

- Maintenance: Maintain the requirements throughout the life cycle of the app. Update the requirements as needed to reflect changes in the app, such as new features or changes in the operating environment.

By following these steps in the requirement engineering process, you can ensure that the mobile app for fitness tracking meets the needs of stakeholders and is delivered on time and within budget.
