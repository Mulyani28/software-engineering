    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that
        the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
        highlighters.</p>

    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by
        an indelible black ink
        that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's
        inception in 1947.</p>

    <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
        several historic events, such as:
    <ul>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
