# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Students Attendance System

## Key steps in creating an Students Attendance System
Developing an Students Attendance System for a university involves several key steps:

### 1. Identify user needs
 Start by understanding the needs of the users, such as students, teachers, and administrators. This will involve gathering requirements and understanding the features and functionalities the system must provide to meet those needs.

### 2. Determine system architecture
Based on the requirements, design the system architecture, including the different components, their interactions, and the data flow. You may also need to consider the integration of the system with existing systems or tools used by the educational institution.

### 3. Choose the technology stack
Select the programming language, database, and development framework to build the system based on the system architecture and the expertise of your team.

### 4. Develop the system
Write code, create a database, and test the system to ensure that it meets the requirements. This will involve implementing features such as real-time attendance tracking, generating attendance reports, and user authentication and access control.

### 5. Test the system
Thoroughly test the system for functionality, security, and performance. This will involve testing features such as user authentication and access control, real-time attendance tracking, and generating attendance reports.

### 6. Deploy the system
Once the system has been developed and tested, deploy it on a server or cloud platform. Configure the system for different users and roles, and ensure that users are provided with adequate training to use the system.

### 7. Maintain the system
Regularly maintain the system by fixing any bugs that arise, updating the system as needed to meet changing needs, and ensuring that it remains secure and user-friendly. This will involve monitoring the system for performance and security issues and providing support to users as needed.
