<hr style="border:0.5px solid gray;height:0.5px;">

### 2. Background:
Events are an essential part of the University of Technology, Malaysia (UTM) experience. However, the current manual process of managing events is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks the ability to provide real-time information about event performance. These difficulties have had a detrimental effect on participants' overall experiences, leading to poor event organisation and low participation rates.

The proposed UTM Event Management System aims to address these challenges by introducing an innovative, intuitive, and automated system that streamlines the event management process. The proposed system leverages the latest technologies and industry best practices to deliver a seamless user experience for organisers, attendees, and administrators. Real-time event scheduling, registration, different sorts of activities and credits, and feedback capabilities are among the system's key features, which give organisers and administrators the ability to optimise event planning, monitor performance, and make informed data-driven decisions.

All stakeholders, including organisers, attendees, and administrators, stand to benefit considerably from the proposed UTM Event Management System. The suggested method will save time, cut down on errors, and boost satisfaction by lessening the administrative burden of manual processes. The system will also offer insightful analytics that can be utilised to inform decisions that will enhance the outcomes of events. Overall, the suggested approach has the potential to establish UTM as a pioneer in event management innovation and technology and strengthen its competitive edge in luring and retaining attendees.

In summary, the UTM Event Management System proposal seeks to address the challenges associated with the current manual event management process by introducing a modern, automated, and user-friendly solution that provides measurable benefits and enhances the overall experience of all stakeholders. The proposed system has the potential to transform event management at UTM, improve event outcomes, and enhance UTM's reputation as a leading institution of higher learning.

### 5. Software Process Model:
A software process model's main objective is to offer a framework for the systematic and organised development of software. It offers a collection of tasks, products, and deadlines to make sure the software is created quickly and effectively. A software process model's main objective is to make sure that the software is high-quality, delivered on time, and within budget while also meeting the requirements of the stakeholders.

The <b>Agile software development process model</b> is the ideal software process model for this campus event management system development. The Agile process model is an adaptable and iterative method of developing software that places a focus on teamwork, client satisfaction, and the quick delivery of functional software. This process model emphasises delivering value to the customer at each iteration and is appropriate for projects with varying requirements and uncertainties.

The Agile process model was chosen because it enables frequent feedback and changes to be made to the software while it is being developed. Since this system is being created for a university, it is likely that the requirements will change and be updated as the project moves forward. The Agile process model is well suited to handle such changes and still deliver a high-quality product on time.

The Agile process model consists of the following phases:

#### 1. Planning and Design Phase: 
During this stage, the team establishes the project's scope, objectives, and goals. A product backlog, which is a prioritised list of the system's features or requirements, is also created by the team. The requirement analyst team works in conjunction with the stakeholders during this phase to compile and assess the system requirements. The group then develops user stories, which are concise, controllable chunks of functionality that can be worked on iteratively. The team will develop a thorough system design, complete with user interfaces, data models, and system architecture, during this phase. The team will also develop a mockup or prototype of the system so that stakeholders can give input and verify that the design satisfies their requirements.

#### 2. Development Phase:
The team will start coding the system and integrating the various components throughout this phase. To make sure that the code is functioning as expected and that the system is meeting the project requirements, this phase calls for frequent testing and teamwork.

#### 3. Testing and Deployment Phase:
During this stage, the team will test the system to make sure it complies with the specifications and performs as anticipated. System testing, integration testing, and unit testing are all included in this. To make sure the system satisfies users' needs and expectations, the team will also collaborate with stakeholders to carry out user acceptance testing. For deployment, the team will deploy the system to the production environment and make it available to users. This includes final testing and validation, as well as training for users and support staff.

#### Testing Methodologies: 
-The quality assurance analyst will use various testing methodologies such as black-box testing, white-box testing, and grey-box testing.
##### i. Black-box testing:
Also referred to as functional testing or behavioural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is unaware of the internal workings of the system being tested. The tester in this method only has access to the system's inputs and outputs, and they test the system's functionality in accordance with its specifications and requirements. In our case, the system's end users (students) will conduct this kind of testing.

##### ii. White-box testing
Also known as structural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is aware of how the system being tested operates on the inside. This approach involves running tests on the system's internal components, such as code or algorithms, to make sure they work as intended. Developers or testers with access to the source code (the team members) of the system being tested usually carry out white-box testing.

##### iii. Grey-box testing:
With this approach, the tester is only partially aware of how the system being tested operates internally. This enables them to test the system's functionality and internal structures to make sure everything is operating as it should. Grey-box testing is typically carried out by testers who have some familiarity with the inner workings of the system but not enough to carry out thorough white-box testing. In this case, it will be the IT administrator staff.


#### Project Management Practices: 
We can use Agile project management practices such as Scrum to manage the project. The team can have daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospective meetings.

#### Quality Assurance Processes: 
The quality assurance analyst along with the team members will ensure that the system meets the quality standards by performing various testing activities and creating test reports. The main developer and developer assistant will also perform unit testing and code reviews to ensure the quality of the code.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid gray;height:0.5px;">

### 6. Budget:
The development of the academic course registration system for 30,000 users within a year will involve various costs, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. The budget for this project is estimated at **RM 900,000**, as outlined below:

- **Hardware Costs: RM 400,000** <br>
This includes the cost of servers, storage, networking equipment, and other hardware required to support the system. This cost will vary depending on the specific hardware configuration chosen, but it is essential to ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users and data volume.

- **Software Costs: RM 150,000** <br>
This includes the cost of licences for any third-party software required, such as operating systems, databases, and development tools. It also includes the cost of any software development needed for the project, such as custom modules or integrations.

- **Personnel Costs: RM 54,000** <br>
This includes the cost of the development team, project managers, and quality assurance specialists. The team size and composition will vary depending on the complexity of the project, but it is essential to ensure that the team has the necessary skills and experience to complete the project on time and within budget.

- **Testing Costs: RM 95,500** <br>
This includes the cost of testing the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. This cost will depend on the testing approach chosen, such as manual or automated testing.

- **Other Expenses: RM 100,500** <br>
This includes the cost of rent for office space, utilities, marketing and advertising, and testing.

- **Contingency Plan: RM 100,000** <br>
It is always recommended to have a contingency plan for unexpected expenses that may arise during the project. This can include budget reserves or adjusting the scope of the project if necessary.

In conclusion, the estimated budget for the development of the UTM Event Management System is RM 900,000. The budget will cover the costs associated with hardware, software, personnel, testing, and contingency. Any changes in the budget will be communicated to stakeholders and project sponsors.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid gray;height:0.5px;">

### 7. System Architecture:

The proposed system architecture for the event management system will be a web-based system built using modern technologies and frameworks. The system will use the following tools and technologies:

- Programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- Frameworks: Laravel, Bootstrap
- Database: MySQL
- Server: Apache
- Data Visualization: Chart.js
The system will have a multi-tier architecture consisting of a presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. The presentation layer will be responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. The application layer will be responsible for implementing the business logic of the system and handling user requests. The data layer will be responsible for storing and managing data.

To implement the RBAC functionality, we will use Laravel's built-in authorization features to restrict user access based on their roles and permissions. Different interfaces will be provided to each user role based on their needs and permissions.

User input data will be stored in the MySQL database. The system will have tables for events, users, organisers, and other entities. The system will also have tables for storing user input data, such as registration forms, event applications, and venue requests. The data layer will use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to map database tables to PHP classes and provide an abstraction layer for managing data.

Data analysis and visualisation will be implemented using Chart.js, a JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs. We can use Chart.js to visualise data such as event participation rates, event categories, and other metrics.

To improve the load time of the page, we can implement caching techniques such as browser caching, server-side caching, and database caching. We can also optimise images and other assets to reduce page size and improve load time.

The block diagram for the proposed system architecture is as follows:

Quality Assurance and Testing Procedures

- Automated Unit Testing: Code will be tested automatically by a unit testing framework during the development phase to ensure that individual units of code work correctly.
- Manual System Testing: After the front-end and back-end of the system are developed, a quality assurance analyst will perform manual system testing to ensure that the system works correctly as a whole.
- User Acceptance Testing: End users will perform testing on the system to ensure that it meets their requirements and expectations.
- Bug Fixing: Any issues or bugs found during testing will be addressed by the development team and retested before being deployed.

### 12. Conclusion:

The proposed system aims to improve the usability and effectiveness of the previous system by addressing the issue of low participation rates in co-curricular activities in universities while also enhancing the effectiveness of promoting events to students.

One of the key features of the new system is that it will be accessible to a wide range of users, including students, club and society administrators, lecturers, and administrators in faculties and departments.

Each user will have a specific set of functions and capabilities tailored to their respective roles and responsibilities. For example, students will be able to use the system to browse and sign up for co-curricular activities and customise their calendar for the activity they have joined. Club administrators will be able to create and manage events, submit acknowledgement and application letters, reserve the venue for the physical event, and promote their event on the student page. Faculty and department administrators will have the ability to oversee the system's usage, monitor participation rates, and record events that take place in the university.

Moreover, the new system will offer a high degree of customization and flexibility for each user. This will include the ability to set preferences, adjust settings, and personalise their user interface. The system will also feature notifications, reminders, and feedback mechanisms to ensure that users are engaged and informed about relevant events and activities.

Overall, the new system represents a significant improvement over the previous system by providing greater accessibility, functionality, and customization for users at all levels of the university community.
