### 1. Executive Summary
- Our proposed badal hajj and umrah management system is an innovative solution designed to facilitate and simplify the registration and handling bulk data process for the management of the company. The system leverages cutting-edge technologies and best practices to deliver a seamless user experience that enables client to easily register their information using the system and can get the all document needed in short period of time. For the user experience in the management side, they can easiy monitor and handle bulk data without losing or overlooked the client information. Key features of this system include real-time processed document, automatic data handling and management and real-time payment. Ultimately, our badal hajj and umrah management system will deliver measurable value to all stakeholders, including increased in client satisfactory, improved workflow of the management and enhanced managing bulk data. By investing in this system, the company will have a smooth and better workflow thus increase the efficiency of the company.

### 2. Background:
Badal Hajj is the act of performing hajj for other people that cannot do hajj on their own in under some circumstances. The time for doing the badal hajj is as same as hajj which is once a year unlike doing umrah. However, the current manual system which 80% handled by human can be cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone. The process is characterized by long waiting, paper-based form, use Whatsaap to send and get the information and human error likely to be occur due to managing bulk data. This manual system often reuslt in delays, errors and frustration for both company and client, leading to a neagtive impact on the overall company's name.

Our proposed badal hajj and umrah system aims to address these challenges by introducing a modern, intuitive and automated sytem that streamlines the workflow. The proposed system leverages the latest technologies and best practices to deliver a seamless user experience for the company and client.  Key features of this system include real-time processed document, automatic data handling and management and real-time payment. The management, they can easiy monitor and handle bulk data without losing or overlooked the client information.

The proposed badah hajj and umrah management system has the potential to significantly improve overall workflow experience for the company and client. By reducing the management burden of manual processes, the proposed system will save time, reduce errors and increased the client satisfaction. Additionally, the system will provide valuable help to manage all the data that have been received by the client. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to smooth out and simplify the workflow thus can increase the company management efficiency.

### 3. Objectives:
Our proposed badal hajj and umrah management system aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Improve efficiency and reduce management burden: The system aims to reduce the time and resources required for manual processes by automating the process. The objective is to streamline the registration process, reduce administrative workload, and reduce human error in managing client information
>**Example**: The manual process of getting information 50% by using Whatsaap and 50% by walk in. The proposed system will reduced the usage of Whatsaap and walk in by 10%-15%.

2. Enhance client experience and engagement: The system aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easier for client to register and send tehir the information to the company without going to the comaony. The objective is to improve the overall client experience, increase engagement, and promote ease for the client.
>**Example**: The proposed system will increase client satisfaction with the process by 30%, resulting in a 10% increase in client user experience.

3. Improve bulk data managing: The system aims to provide bulk data managing and increase efficiency during data management. The objective is to decrease human error such as forgetting the info or confusion and avoid the management from overlook the data..
>**Example**: The proposed system will improve bulk data managing while decreasing human error during managing all of the client info.

Overall, these SMART objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They align with the goals and objectives of the project and provide a clear roadmap for achieving the desired outcomes.

### 4. Scope: 
The system will allow user to create an account and and make the registration for the hajj or umrah ,user will fill in the important information such as full name,age,address,contact number and more. This system also will be included the section for health information to know the applicants health status for the screening process by those responsible managing the registrations.Some limitations for this project is the security part which the system need to be achieve a certain security stndard to protect those informations and prevent from any breach or unauthorized access.Other than that, the project need to be completed on time or it will affect the success of the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
