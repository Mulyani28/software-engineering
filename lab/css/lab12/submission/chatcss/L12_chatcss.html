            1904 when a Tehnical School began its operation on Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to 
            teach Technical Assistants for the Federated Malay States Department of Railways, Survey
            and Public Works.

            recommended that the Technical School be elevated to a college status and proposed that a <br>
            new Technical College he constructed. The new college was to be built on a 47-acre piece of <br>
            Government land in Gurney Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the <br>
            construction of the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in <br>
            Peninsular Malaysia.
