# Software Requirements Document (SRD): College Room Rental System

Creating a college room rental system can be a complex project, but here are some key steps to consider:

#### 1. Identify the requirements: 
Define the features and functionality of your college room rental system. For example, will it allow students to search for available rooms, reserve a room, pay for the reservation, or review past reservations?

#### 2. Design the system architecture: 
Create a high-level architecture for your system, including the database structure, user interface design, and technology stack. Choose the appropriate programming language, database management system, and front-end framework.

#### 3. Develop the backend: 
Develop the server-side of your system using the chosen technology stack. Implement the database schema, API endpoints, and server-side logic.

#### 4. Develop the frontend: 
Develop the client-side of your system using a front-end framework. Implement the user interface design, user authentication, and client-side logic.

#### 5. Test the system: 
Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the system functions correctly and is free from bugs and errors.

#### 6. Deploy the system: 
Deploy the system to a production environment and configure it for scalability, reliability, and security.

#### 7. Maintain the system: 
Continuously monitor the system and resolve any issues that arise. Provide support to users and make improvements and enhancements to the system as needed.


## Requirements Engineering

Requirements engineering is a critical part of the software development process that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and constraints of stakeholders for the system. Here are some important steps in the requirements engineering process for creating a college room rental system:

#### 1. Identify the stakeholders: 
Determine who the stakeholders are, including students, administrators, and landlords. Understand their roles and responsibilities in the room rental process.

#### 2. Gather requirements: 
Collect the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Functional requirements are what the system should do, while non-functional requirements are how the system should behave.

#### 3. Prioritize requirements: 
Prioritize requirements based on their importance, urgency, and feasibility. Ensure that the most critical requirements are addressed first.

#### 4. Document requirements: 
Document the requirements using a consistent and clear format. Use diagrams, flowcharts, and use cases to help convey the requirements.

#### 5. Validate requirements: 
Validate the requirements with the stakeholders to ensure that they meet their needs and expectations. Clarify any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the requirements.

#### 6. Manage requirements:
Manage changes to the requirements throughout the development process. Ensure that changes are properly documented and communicated to all stakeholders.

Remember that requirements engineering is an iterative process, and requirements may evolve as the development process progresses. It is important to stay flexible and adapt to changing needs and constraints throughout the project.
