# Module 4:  Requirements Engineering

### Contents:

### Requirement Engineering

Requirement engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a software system. It involves defining the needs and constraints of the system, identifying stakeholders, and specifying the functional and non-functional requirements.

The goal of requirement engineering is to ensure that the software system meets the needs of its users and stakeholders, and is delivered on time, within budget, and with the required quality.

Here is an example of how to use requirement engineering in a software development project:

```python
# Import requirement engineering module
import requirement_engineering

# Elicit requirements from stakeholders
requirements = requirement_engineering.elicit_requirements()

# Analyze requirements for feasibility and completeness
feasibility = requirement_engineering.analyze_feasibility(requirements)
completeness = requirement_engineering.analyze_completeness(requirements)

# Document requirements in a software requirements specification (SRS) document
requirement_engineering.document_requirements(requirements, 'software_requirements_specification.docx')

# Validate requirements with stakeholders
requirement_engineering.validate_requirements(requirements)

# Manage requirements throughout the software development lifecycle
requirement_engineering.manage_requirements(requirements)
