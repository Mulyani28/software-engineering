### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Accommodation System proposal for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) is aimed at addressing the challenges that students and staff face when managing student accommodation. The current process for applying for and managing accommodation is manual and time-consuming, which can result in delays, errors, and frustration for students and staff alike.

To address these challenges, the proposed software system will provide an online platform that allows students to apply for accommodation, make payments, and track the status of their application. KTDI staff will be able to manage room availability and allocation, communicate with students, and access relevant data and reports through a centralized dashboard.

The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and prompts throughout the process. It will also incorporate automated communication channels, such as email notifications, to keep students and staff updated on the status of their applications and requests.

The expected outcomes of the project include improved student satisfaction, as the software system will provide a more convenient and streamlined process for managing accommodation. KTDI staff will also benefit from increased efficiency, as the system will reduce the need for manual data entry and administrative tasks. Finally, the system is expected to reduce errors and delays in the accommodation management process, resulting in a more reliable and efficient system overall.

### 2. Background:
- The student accommodation system is an essential aspect of managing student life on a university campus. It automates the process of assigning student room and ensures that students are placed in suitable accommodations that meet their needs and preferences. The system is vital in providing a comfortable and safe living environment for students, promoting their academic success and overall well-being. However, the current manual and unorganised system in KTDI can be time-consuming, prone to error and inconsistencies, leading to inefficiencies in the room application and management process and a poor user experience for both students and administrators.

- Our proposed student accommodation system is focused to overcome these challenges via devloping a modern, spontaneous automated system that streamline the room rentaling and managing process. To provide students, staff, and administrators with a seamless user experience, the proposed system makes advantage of the most recent technology and best practises. The developed system will provide an efficient and effective way for students to apply for hostel online based on their selections and for administrators to allocate housing quickly and accurately.

- The key features of this system include a user-friendly interface that integrates with other university systems such as billing and student information, and enhanced data analysis capabilities to provide insights into occupancy rates, student preferences, and college merits. It also embraces features such as tracking maintenance requests, scheduling repairs and replacements, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations to ensure that student accommodations are well-maintained and safe. Thus, this system enables students to take control on their hostel selection and staff and administrators will additionally profit from enhanced room management, data analytics, and more effective working operation.
  
- The student accommodation system features offer significant benefits for the university community, with the potential to impact the accommodation allocation process positively. The automation of the allocation process will increase efficiency, save time, and eliminate errors that often occur during manual allocation. The online application process will simplify the application process for students, creating a better user experience. The data analysis capabilities will allow administrators to make informed decisions about future housing allocation, resulting in a more strategic and effective approach. The enhanced security measures will protect students' personal information, improving privacy and security. The maintenance system will ensure the hostel remains well-maintained, creating a comfortable and safe living environment for students. Overall, the student accommodation system features will improve the quality of the accommodation allocation process, streamline processes, improve the student experience, and enhance the reputation of the university.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
The scope of the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) refers to the boundaries or limits of the project, defining what elements the system will and won't have. It outlines the features and functionalities of the system, including its goals, objectives, and requirements, as well as the expected outcomes and benefits. Here are more detailed explanations of the features and functionality of a student accommodation system:

- Student registration: By entering their personal information, academic information, and housing preferences, students can register as users in the system using the student registration tool. Before letting a student register, the system should confirm their identity and determine whether they qualify for accommodations.

- Room allocation: According on the students' choices, availability, and budget, the system can assign rooms to them using the room allocation tool. The system should include elements including the student's academic programme, year of study, and any unique requirements or requests.

- Room management: The room management feature allows students to manage their rooms through the system. This includes room bookings, check-in, check-out, and maintenance requests. The system should provide a calendar view of the room availability and allow students to book their preferred room and check-in and check-out dates. It should also allow students to request maintenance services for their room and track the status of the request.

- Payment management: Students can use the system to pay their lodging costs thanks to the payment management tool. The system should enable students to monitor their payment history and receipts and offer safe payment options like credit card or internet banking. 

- User management: Administrators can manage user accounts for students, staff, and other users via the user management tool. To make sure that users only have access to the functions and information they require, the system should offer capabilities like account creation, modification, and deletion as well as role-based access control.

- Security: The security element guarantees the safety of the system and safeguards the private data of the students. For data transmission and storage, the system should employ secure encryption techniques, and features like access control and two-factor authentication should be available to guard against unauthorised access.

- Reporting and analytics:The reporting and analytics feature allows administrators to monitor and analyze the occupancy rates, revenue, and maintenance issues of the accommodation system. Reports from the system should include occupancy rates by programme or room type, revenue by time period, and building or room-specific maintenance issues.

- Support and maintenance: The system's technical assistance and maintenance are provided by the support and maintenance function. Users should be able to report problems or request assistance through the system's help desk or ticketing system, and there should be a dedicated team working to quickly resolve these problems.

Besides,there are several limitations and constraints that may affect the project of a student accommodation system for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI). The following examples are:
 
- Timeframe: The project's constrained timeline can have an impact on the system's scope. The quantity of work that can be accomplished may be constrained by the time available, which could lead to the elimination of particular features or functionalities. The timetable may also have an impact on the system's quality because hurried development might result in mistakes, faults, or missing functionality.

- Technical constraints: Technical limitations, such as compatibility with current systems or infrastructure, a lack of available storage or processing power, or security issues, may place restrictions on the system's reach. The project team may need to assess the infrastructure already in place and decide whether the system is compatible with it. Technical limitations might also call for more resources or specialised experts to be resolved.

- Data privacy: Data privacy is a significant restriction that has an impact on the gathering, storing, and usage of personal data. The system's features, such as the volume of data that can be gathered or retained, may be constrained by data privacy laws and regulations. To prevent unauthorised access to confidential information, the system must also be developed with security in mind.
  
- User acceptance: User adoption and acceptance are crucial to the system's success. To be widely accepted and used, a system must fulfil user needs and expectations. Limited user acceptability could lead to decreased utilisation and a worse ROI. To make sure the system satisfies user needs, the project team may need to undertake user testing and feedback.

- Scalability: To support expansion and growth in the future, the system must be scalable. The architecture and design of the system must be able to accommodate growing numbers of students, rooms, and data. For the system to last and be able to change with the needs of the user, scalability limits may call for more resources or specialised staff.
  
By defining the scope of the project, the project team can establish the foundation for the project plan, which outlines the specific tasks, resources, timelines, and budgets needed to achieve the project goals.
