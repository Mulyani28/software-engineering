## Module outline 
## I. Introduction
### Overview of requirements analysis and modeling

Requirements analysis is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle that involves understanding, documenting, and validating the needs of stakeholders for a software system. This phase helps to ensure that the final product meets the expectations of users, business owners, and other stakeholders.

Requirements modeling, on the other hand, involves creating a visual representation of the requirements using various techniques and tools. These models help to communicate the requirements clearly to all stakeholders and provide a basis for designing and developing the software system.

There are different approaches to requirements analysis and modeling, but some common steps include:

<ul><li>Elicitation: This involves gathering information from stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints.</li>

<li>Analysis: This involves organizing and categorizing the requirements to identify commonalities, conflicts, and ambiguities.</li>

<li>Specification: This involves documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner using techniques such as use cases, user stories, or functional requirements.</li>

<li>Validation: This involves reviewing and testing the requirements to ensure they are complete, correct, and consistent.</li>

<li>Modeling: This involves creating visual representations of the requirements using techniques such as data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, or use case diagrams.</li></ul>

Requirements modeling techniques help to represent the requirements in a way that is easy to understand for stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise. For example, use case diagrams show the interactions between actors and the system, while data flow diagrams show how data moves through the system.

Overall, requirements analysis and modeling are critical for the success of software development projects as they ensure that the software system meets the needs of stakeholders and is delivered on time and within budget.

## II. Part I: Requirements Modeling Concept
### A. Understanding the Concept of Requirements Modeling
### <ul><li>Importance of requirements modeling in software development</li></ul>
Requirements modeling is a critical phase in software development that involves creating a detailed description of the desired behavior and functionality of the software system to be developed. Here are some key reasons why requirements modeling is essential in software development:

<ul><li>Establishing a common understanding: The process of requirements modeling helps establish a common understanding of the software system to be developed among all stakeholders. This includes the development team, customers, end-users, and other stakeholders. By creating a clear and comprehensive set of requirements, everyone involved in the project can have a shared understanding of what the software system should do.</li>

<li>Defining project scope: Requirements modeling helps to define the scope of the software project by clarifying what features and functionality are within the scope of the project and what are not. This helps to avoid scope creep, which can lead to increased project costs, delays, and customer dissatisfaction.</li>

<li>Minimizing rework: Requirements modeling helps to identify and correct issues early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of costly rework later. By understanding the requirements, the development team can identify potential issues or conflicts early on, reducing the risk of costly rework.</li>

<li>Improving quality: Requirements modeling helps to ensure that the software system meets the needs of its users by specifying the required functionality and behavior. This helps to improve the quality of the software system and increases the likelihood that it will be successful in the market.</li>

<li>Facilitating communication:** Requirements modeling provides a common language for communication between the development team and stakeholders. This helps to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the software system to be developed, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or miscommunications.</li></ul>

## B. Techniques for Requirements Modeling
### 1. Use Case Modeling and Specification
### <ul><li>Definition and purpose of use case modeling and specification</li>
  Use case modeling and specification is a technique used in software development to capture the functional requirements of a system by identifying and describing its interactions with actors, which could be users, other systems, or external entities.

Use case modeling involves identifying the different use cases or scenarios that a user or system might encounter when interacting with the software. Each use case is described in terms of the steps or actions that the actor takes and the responses or outcomes of the system.

Use case specification involves documenting the use cases in detail, including the actors involved, the preconditions, the steps or actions taken, the post-conditions or outcomes, and any exceptions or alternative paths that may occur.

The purpose of use case modeling and specification is to ensure that the software meets the needs of the users or stakeholders, and that it is developed according to the requirements and specifications. It helps to identify and address potential problems or issues early on in the development process, and it also provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of how the system will be used and what it is supposed to do.
</ul>

### <ul><li>Techniques for creating use case models</li>
**Narrative:**
A narrative use case model is a type of use case model that focuses on describing the behavior of a system from the perspective of the end-user or actor. In contrast to traditional use case models, which are typically presented in a diagrammatic or tabular format, narrative use case models are presented in prose form.

The narrative use case model typically begins with a description of the actor, which is the user or system that interacts with the system being modeled. This is followed by a description of the goal or objective that the actor wishes to achieve when interacting with the system.

The narrative then proceeds to describe the steps that the actor takes to achieve their goal, and the system responses at each step. These steps are often presented in the form of a sequence of events or a flowchart, which helps to illustrate the interactions between the actor and the system.

One of the key advantages of using a narrative use case model is that it can help to facilitate communication between the development team and stakeholders. Because the narrative is presented in a more natural language format, it is often easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand the behavior of the system and provide feedback.

Overall, narrative use case models can be a useful tool for describing the behavior of a system from the perspective of the end-user, and can help to facilitate communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders.
