### 1. Executive Summary
- The UTM online grading system is a project that seeks to enhance the grading process for students and faculty members at the University of Technology, Malaysia. The project's goal is to develop a digital platform that will enable real-time grading, monitoring of student progress, and generation of reports. The system will also provide students with access to their grades, schedules, and academic progress reports. By improving accuracy and fairness in grading, reducing administrative overheads, and enhancing the student experience, the project aims to increase academic performance, engagement, and satisfaction while improving overall institutional efficiency. Ultimately, the UTM online grading system will support the university's mission of delivering a high-quality education that prepares students for success in a rapidly evolving global economy.

### 2. Background:
- The UTM online grading system is a software project aimed at improving the grading process for students and faculty members at the University of Technology, Malaysia. The proposal seeks to address the challenges posed by the traditional paper-based grading system, such as delays and inaccuracies in grading, and difficulties in tracking student progress. 
- The project aims to develop a digital platform that will streamline the grading process and provide benefits such as faster grading, greater transparency and accountability, and improved communication. By adopting a digital platform for grading and record-keeping, the university will become more efficient and better equipped to provide a high-quality education to its students in a rapidly evolving global economy.

### 3. Objectives:
- To develop a digital platform for real-time grading that improves accuracy, transparency, and accountability, reducing errors and delays associated with traditional paper-based grading systems.
- To provide a centralized system for recording and tracking student progress, enabling faculty members to monitor academic performance and provide timely feedback to students.
- To enable students to access their grades, schedules, and academic progress reports in real-time, improving their understanding of their progress and enhancing their learning experience.
- To reduce administrative overheads associated with grading and record-keeping, allowing faculty members to focus on teaching and research activities, improving institutional efficiency and productivity.
- To enhance the overall student experience by providing a modern, user-friendly interface for grading and record-keeping, improving engagement and satisfaction with the university's academic processes.

### 4. Scope: 
- User Authentication: The system should allow instructors and students to authenticate themselves using their UTM credentials.
- Grading Management: The system should allow instructors to create and manage grading components, such as assignments, quizzes, and exams, and assign grades to       
  students for each component.
- Grade Calculation: The system should automatically calculate and display final grades based on the grading components and their weightage, as well as handle any special grading policies, such as dropping the lowest grade.
- Grade Submission: The system should allow instructors to submit grades to the university's official grading system.
- Grade Viewing: The system should allow students to view their grades for each component, as well as their overall course grade.
- Feedback and Communication: The system should allow instructors to provide feedback to students on their performance and communicate with them through the system.
- Course Management: The system should allow instructors to manage their course details, such as course description, schedule, and syllabus.
- Accessibility: The system should be accessible to users with disabilities, and support assistive technologies such as screen readers.
- Security: The system should be designed with appropriate security measures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of student information and grading data.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- The goal of the software process model is to provide a systematic and structured approach to software development that maximizes efficiency, reduces risk, and improves the overall quality of the UTM online grading system.
- For the UTM online grading system, the ideal software process model would be the iterative and incremental model. The iterative and incremental model is a flexible and adaptable approach that involves a series of iterations, each consisting of planning, designing, developing, testing, and delivering phases. This model is ideal for projects where requirements are likely to change or evolve, as it allows for flexibility and adaptability.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
- The risk assessment section identifies and assesses any potential risks that could impact the project, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or changes in project requirements. 
- It should also describe the plans and strategies to mitigate those risks.

### 9. Resources:
- Provide a detailed breakdown of the resources required for the proposed project, including staff, equipment, software, and other expenses.

### 10. Technical Specifications:
- Discuss the technical specifications of the proposed project, including data sources, data schema, data transformations, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other technical details.
- Mention the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that will be used in the project.
- Provide details about the hardware and software requirements for the proposed system.
- Explain the data security measures that will be implemented.

### 11. Timeline and Deliverables: 
- Provide a detailed timeline for the project, including milestones and deadlines.
- Specify the deliverables that will be provided at each milestone. It should also specify the expected time frame for each deliverable and the resources that will be required to complete the project.
- Explain the quality assurance and testing procedures that will be followed.

### 12. Conclusion:
- Conclude your proposal with a call to action, highlighting the benefits of your proposed solution and urging the decision-makers to take action.
- Summarize the proposal and reiterate the importance of the project.
- Mention any potential limitations or challenges that may arise during the project.
- Provide a call to action for the client to approve the proposal and proceed with the project.
