# Part 5: Requirements Engineering 

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. The IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) is a standard document that specifies the requirements for a software system in a clear and concise manner.

The following are the generic activities that are common to all requirements engineering processes:

| Generic Activities  | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Requirements elicitation | Gathering requirements from stakeholders by identifying their needs and documenting their requirements. |
| Requirements analysis | Analyzing and refining the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. |
| Requirements validation | Verifying that the requirements meet the needs of stakeholders by checking if they are feasible, testable, and traceable. |
| Requirements management | Organizing and controlling the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle by identifying changes, tracking their status, and ensuring proper documentation and communication. | 


The process of creating an SRD for an academic course registration system. The following are the steps involved in creating an SRD:

1. Identify the stakeholders: In this step, we need to identify the stakeholders of the academic course registration system. These stakeholders may include students, faculty, administrators, and staff.

2. Elicit the requirements: In this step, we need to gather the requirements from the stakeholders. We can use techniques such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups to elicit the requirements.

3. Analyze the requirements: In this step, we need to analyze and refine the requirements that have been elicited. We should ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.

4. Validate the requirements: In this step, we need to verify that the requirements meet the needs of the stakeholders. We should ensure that the requirements are feasible, testable, and traceable.

5. Document the requirements: In this step, we need to document the requirements in the form of an SRD. The SRD should be clear and concise, and it should include all the requirements that have been elicited, analyzed, and validated.

6. Manage the requirements: In this step, we need to organize and control the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. We should identify changes to the requirements, track their status, and ensure that they are properly documented and communicated to stakeholders.

In conclusion, the process of requirements engineering is crucial in the development of software systems. By following the generic activities of requirements elicitation, analysis, validation, and management, and by creating an SRD for an academic course registration system, we can ensure that the requirements are clear, concise, and meet the needs of the stakeholders.
