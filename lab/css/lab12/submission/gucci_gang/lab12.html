        <p>The history of technical education in this country has been a century old. It all began in 1904 when a Technical
        School began its operation on Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to teach Technical Assistants for the Federated
        Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works.</p>
        <p>The school was officially known as Treacher Technical School, named after Sir William Treacher, the Resident General
        during that time. Students followed classed on part-time basis; they worked and trained specifically according to
        the technical needs of their employment.</p>
        <p>Department In 1941, the Advisory Committee of Technical Schools and the Education recommended that the Technical
        School be elevated to a college status and proposed that a new Technical College be constructed. The new college was
        to be built on a 47-acre piece of Government land in Gurney Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the
        construction of the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
