# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management System

 Key steps involved in creating a student health and wellness management system: 

## 1. System Requirements Gathering:
The first step in creating any system is to gather requirements from stakeholders. In this case, the stakeholders would be students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators. You can conduct interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather requirements from these stakeholders. Some of the requirements for a student health and wellness management system may include the ability to track health records, schedule appointments, and receive reminders for upcoming appointments.

## 2. System Design:
Once you have gathered the requirements, the next step is to design the system. You will need to create a detailed system architecture that outlines the various components of the system and how they will interact with each other. This will include designing the user interface, the database schema, and the backend server.

## 3. System Development:
After the system design is complete, the next step is to develop the system. You will need to hire a team of developers to build the system according to the design. You will also need to test the system to ensure that it is working as intended. During the development process, you should also focus on making the system user-friendly and easy to use.

## 4. System Deployment:
Once the system has been developed and tested, the next step is to deploy it. This will involve installing the system on servers and configuring it to work with the school's existing IT infrastructure. You will also need to train school staff and students on how to use the system.

## 5. System Maintenance:
The final step is to maintain the system. This will involve fixing bugs, adding new features, and ensuring that the system is running smoothly. You will also need to keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against cyber attacks.

## Requirement Engineering

Overview of the steps involved in the requirement engineering process for a health and wellness management system:

1. Elicitation: This involves identifying and gathering information from stakeholders such as students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators. Different techniques can be used for elicitation, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observation. The goal of this step is to understand the needs and requirements of the stakeholders for the health and wellness management system.

2. Analysis: This step involves analyzing the information gathered during the elicitation process. The aim is to identify the features, functions, and requirements of the system. The analysis also helps to identify any constraints, risks, and challenges that may affect the system development.

3. Specification: In this step, the requirements are documented in detail. The specification includes a description of the system's features, functions, and constraints. The requirements specification can take the form of a software requirements specification document, which provides a detailed description of the system requirements.

4. Validation: Once the requirements specification is complete, it must be validated to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and consistent. This can be done through peer review, walkthroughs, and inspections. Validation ensures that the requirements accurately represent the stakeholders' needs and requirements for the health and wellness management system.

5. Verification: This step involves ensuring that the requirements can be implemented in the system design and development. Verification checks the feasibility of the requirements, including their compatibility with existing technology and infrastructure.

6. Management: Requirement management involves tracking and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the system development process. This includes documenting any changes made to the requirements, assessing the impact of those changes, and ensuring that the changes are communicated to all stakeholders.

## User requirements and system requirements

User Requirements:
User requirements refer to the needs and expectations of the users of the system. In the case of a student health and wellness management system, the user requirements can include the following:

1. Health Record Management:
Students should be able to manage their health records easily, including uploading test results, vaccination records, and medical history.

2. Appointment Scheduling:
Students should be able to schedule appointments with healthcare professionals easily and quickly, without having to go through a long process.

3. Reminders and Notifications:
The system should provide students with reminders and notifications of upcoming appointments, medical check-ups, and other important healthcare-related events.

4. User-Friendly Interface:
The user interface of the system should be easy to use and navigate, even for those who are not tech-savvy.

5. Access to Relevant Resources:
The system should provide access to relevant health and wellness resources, including information about mental health, healthy eating, and physical exercise.

<br/>

System Requirements:
System requirements refer to the features and functionalities that the system must have to meet the user requirements. In the case of a student health and wellness management system, the system requirements can include the following:

1. Health Record Management System:
The system should provide a comprehensive health record management system that enables students to manage their health records securely.

2. Appointment Scheduling System:
The system should have an appointment scheduling system that allows students to schedule appointments with healthcare professionals easily.

3. Reminders and Notifications System:
The system should have a reminders and notifications system that sends notifications to students about upcoming appointments, medical check-ups, and other healthcare-related events.

4. User-Friendly Interface:
The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use.

5. Security and Privacy:
The system should have a robust security and privacy system that protects the confidentiality and integrity of student health records.

6. Access to Relevant Resources:
The system should provide access to relevant health and wellness resources, including information about mental health, healthy eating, and physical exercise.

<br/>

Overall, the user requirements and system requirements for a student health and wellness management system are focused on providing students with a comprehensive and user-friendly system for managing their health and wellness needs. The system should be easy to use, secure, and provide access to relevant resources to support students' health and wellness.
