      <b>LANGLEY</b>, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the
      Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds
      of thousands of pages of <ins>critical intelligence information</ins> with
      black highlighters.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">
      According to the report, sections of the documents— <b>"almost invariably the
      most crucial passages"</b>—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders
      the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
      began at the agency's inception in 1947.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">
      CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably
      never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
