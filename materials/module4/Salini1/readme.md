# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Damage Report 

## The following are some key steps to consider when creating a damage report system:

1. Identify the type of damage: The first step is to identify the type of damage that needs to be reported. This can be done by creating a list of common types of damages that may occur and determining which ones are relevant to your organization.

2. Develop a reporting process: Once you have identified the types of damage that need to be reported, you need to develop a process for reporting them. This can include creating a form or online system for employees or customers to report the damage.

3. Determine the scope of the system: Decide who will have access to the damage report system and what types of information they will be able to see. This can help ensure that the system is used appropriately and that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized parties.

4. Assign responsibilities: Determine who will be responsible for receiving and processing damage reports, as well as who will be responsible for taking action to address the reported damages.

5. Establish protocols for follow-up: Once a damage report has been received, it's important to establish protocols for follow-up. This can include investigating the reported damage, taking action to address the damage, and communicating with the person who reported the damage to provide updates on the status of the repair or resolution.

6. Regularly review and update the system: Finally, it's important to regularly review and update the damage report system to ensure that it is meeting the needs of your organization and that any necessary changes are made to improve the system's effectiveness.
