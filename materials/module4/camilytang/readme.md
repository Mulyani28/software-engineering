## Requirement Engineering in creating an Event Management System
### 1. Requirements elicitation: 
This is the process of gathering information from stakeholders about their needs and requirements for the event management system. This may involve conducting interviews with event planners, vendors, sponsors, and attendees to understand their expectations for the system. It is important to identify all stakeholders who may have a vested interest in the system and gather their input.

### 2. Requirements analysis: 
Once the information has been gathered during the requirements elicitation process, it is analyzed to identify the key features and functionalities that the event management system should have. The analysis should take into account the needs and requirements of all stakeholders, and prioritize those features and functionalities that are most important.

### 3. Requirements specification: 
The requirements identified during the analysis stage are documented in a formal document known as a requirements specification. This document provides a detailed description of the features and functionalities that the event management system should have, including any technical requirements and constraints.

### 4. Requirements validation: 
The requirements specification is reviewed to ensure that it is accurate and complete. This may involve reviewing the specification with stakeholders to ensure that their needs and requirements have been properly addressed. Validation may also involve conducting tests to ensure that the system meets the requirements specified in the document.

### 5. Requirements management: 
Requirements management involves managing the requirements throughout the development and maintenance of the event management system. This includes ensuring that the requirements are properly documented, tracked, and updated as necessary. It also involves managing changes to the requirements as the system evolves, and ensuring that all stakeholders are informed of any changes.


## Stakeholders
### 1. Event Planners/Organizers: 
Event planners/organizers are the primary stakeholders involved in the creation of an event management system. They are responsible for designing, planning, and executing the event and use the system to manage various aspects of the event such as registration, scheduling, and communication with attendees.

### 2. Attendees: 
Attendees are another important stakeholder in the event management system. They use the system to register for the event, view the event schedule, and receive updates and notifications regarding the event. It is essential to design the system in a way that is user-friendly and meets the needs of attendees.

### 3. University Administrators
University administrators are an important stakeholder in the event management system, especially if the event is being hosted by a university or educational institution.

The system should provide a clear and intuitive interface for attendees to view and manage event details, and for event planners to manage and schedule events. The system should also provide a customizable interface that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different users.

## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are a type of requirement in campus event management system that describe what the system should do and how it should behave. These requirements are used to ensure that the system meets the needs of its users and stakeholders by performing specific functions or tasks. Functional requirements can be classified as either essential or desirable, and they typically specify how the system should behave in response to certain inputs or user actions.

In campus event management system, functional requirements can include a wide range of capabilities and functionalities, such as:

### 1. Event scheduling and management: 
This functional requirement is crucial for managing multiple events on a single platform. The system must allow event organizers to create, schedule and manage various events, including setting up event details, selecting event dates and times, and assigning resources. It must also provide an easy-to-use interface to enable event organizers to manage multiple events effectively.

### 2. Attendee registration and management: 
 This functional requirement ensures that attendees can easily register for events, and event organizers can manage the attendee list and attendance for each event. The system should allow organizers to create attendee profiles, send registration invitations, and track attendance. This requirement is essential to ensure that the event runs smoothly and attendees receive the necessary information and support.

### 3. Resource management: 
This functional requirement allows event organizers to manage campus resources and assets, including rooms, equipment, and other event-related resources. The system should provide an easy way to manage resource availability and booking, as well as tracking resource usage and inventory. This requirement helps ensure that event organizers can easily find and allocate the necessary resources for an event.

### 4. Communication: 
This functional requirement involves the ability to communicate with event attendees and other stakeholders effectively. The system should provide an easy-to-use communication interface that enables event organizers to send reminders, updates, and notifications about event-related activities. This requirement helps ensure that attendees receive timely and relevant information about events, and stakeholders are kept up-to-date on event progress.

### 5. Reporting and analytics:
This functional requirement allows event organizers to generate reports and analytics related to event performance, attendance, and other relevant metrics. The system should provide a way to analyze data collected from events to identify trends and make informed decisions. This requirement helps event organizers evaluate the success of an event and improve future events.

### 6. Financial Management: 
This functional requirement involves the ability to manage the financial aspects of campus events, including creating budgets, tracking expenses and revenue, generating invoices, and processing payments. It should also provide financial reporting and analytics capabilities, such as budget vs. actual comparisons and forecasting tools. Proper financial management is crucial for the success of campus events, and having a robust financial management system integrated into the event management platform can help ensure that events stay within budget and are financially sustainable in the long run.

Overall, functional requirements play a critical role in the design and development of a campus event management system. By specifying the desired capabilities and functionalities of the system, functional requirements ensure that the system is developed to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders, and that it is designed to be effective, efficient, and user-friendly.
