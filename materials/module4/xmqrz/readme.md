# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Feedback System in University Technology Malaysia

The Software Requirements Document (SRD) for the Student Feedback System in University Technology Malaysia should outline the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. Here are some of the key components that should be included in the SRD:

## 1. Define the Purpose and Scope:
Start by defining the purpose and scope of the SRD. Explain why the document is being created and what it will cover. Identify the stakeholders and their expectations.

## 2. Gather Requirements: 
Conduct interviews with university staff and students to gather requirements for the Student Feedback System. Identify the key features and functionalities of the system. Make a list of all the functional and non-functional requirements.

## 3. Organize Requirements: 
Organize the requirements into categories. Group similar requirements together to make it easier to understand and manage.

## 4. Write Functional Requirements: 
In this section, describe the features and functionalities of the Student Feedback System. Explain how the system will work and what it will do. Use clear and concise language. Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate the system's functionality.

## 5. Write Non-functional Requirements: 
In this section, describe the system's performance, security, and usability requirements. Specify the response time, security features, and level of accessibility required. Be as specific as possible.

## 6. Describe the User Interface: 
In this section, describe the design and layout of the system's user interface. Explain how users will interact with the system. Use screenshots or wireframes to illustrate the user interface.

## 7. Define System Architecture: 
In this section, describe the software and hardware components that will be used to develop and deploy the Student Feedback System. Explain how the components will be integrated to create a functioning system. Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate the system architecture.

## 8. Outline Data Management: 
In this section, describe how the system will manage feedback data. Explain how the data will be stored, backed up, and secured. Specify any data retention policies that apply.

## 9. List Assumptions and Constraints: 
In this section, list any assumptions that were made during the requirements gathering process, as well as any constraints that may impact the development or deployment of the system. For example, budget constraints or resource limitations.

## 10. Define Acceptance Criteria: 
In this section, describe the criteria that must be met for the Student Feedback System to be considered complete and ready for deployment. Specify both functional and non-functional requirements. Define how the system will be tested and evaluated.

By creating a comprehensive SRD, the developers of the Student Feedback System can ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements and can develop a system that meets the needs of the university and its students.

# Requirements Engineering Process

The requirements engineering process for making a student feedback system in University Technology Malaysia can be broken down into several key steps:

## 1. Identify Stakeholders: 
Identify all stakeholders who will be affected by the student feedback system, such as university staff, faculty members, and students. Determine their expectations and requirements for the system.

## 2. Gather Requirements: 
Gather requirements through different techniques such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, and document analysis. This step is critical to identifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the student feedback system.

## 3. Analyze Requirements: 
Analyze the requirements to ensure they are clear, consistent, and complete. Remove any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the requirements.

## 4. Prioritize Requirements: 
Prioritize the requirements based on their importance and feasibility. This will help you determine which requirements to implement first and which can be deferred to later stages of development.

## 5. Specify Requirements: 
Write detailed and unambiguous requirements specifications for the student feedback system. Ensure that the specifications include all functional and non-functional requirements, as well as any constraints or assumptions.

## 6. Validate Requirements: 
Validate the requirements with stakeholders to ensure they meet their needs and expectations. This can be done through reviews, demonstrations, or prototypes.

## 7. Manage Requirements: 
Manage the requirements throughout the development process to ensure they are met. This includes tracking changes to the requirements, resolving conflicts, and verifying that the final product meets all requirements.

## 8. Verify Requirements: 
Verify that the student feedback system meets all requirements through testing, inspection, or walkthroughs.

## 9. Maintain Requirements: 
Maintain the requirements throughout the life cycle of the student feedback system. This includes updating requirements as needed, managing changes, and ensuring that the requirements remain valid and relevant.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the student feedback system meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders at University Technology Malaysia. A thorough requirements engineering process will help you identify and prioritize the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, leading to a successful development process and a useful final product.
