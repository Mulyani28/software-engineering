# Introduction
**Module 4: Requirements Engineering**, is a critical aspect of the software development process that focuses on eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the software requirements. The module is divided into five sections. 

The first section, [Requirements Engineering Introduction](p1-intro.md) provides an overview of the importance of requirements engineering and the key concepts involved in the process. This section establishes the foundation for the rest of the module. 

The second section, [Functional Requirements](p2-functional.md) discusses the functional requirements of the software, which outline the system's capabilities, behavior, and interactions with users and other systems. This section emphasizes the importance of developing clear and concise functional requirements to ensure the software meets the users' needs. 

The third section, [Requirements Specification](p3-soft-requirement.md) focuses on the techniques for specifying the software requirements. This section discusses the different types of software requirements and the tools and methods used to capture and document them. 

The fourth section, [Form Based Specifications](p4-form.md) delves into the specifics of creating software requirements using form-based methods. This section highlights the advantages of using forms to capture requirements and outlines the best practices for designing effective forms. 

The fifth section, [Advance Requirements Engineering](p5-req-eng.md) explores advanced techniques for requirements engineering, such as requirements traceability, validation, and management. This section emphasizes the importance of these techniques in ensuring that the software requirements are complete, consistent, and verifiable. 

Finally, the module concludes with [An interview with a stakeholder](p6-interview.md) where students are exposed to a real-world scenario of conducting an interview with a stakeholder to elicit requirements for a software project. This section provides practical experience and emphasizes the importance of effective communication and stakeholder engagement in requirements engineering. Overall, the module provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the requirements engineering process and the skills necessary to successfully elicit, analyze, and manage software requirements.
