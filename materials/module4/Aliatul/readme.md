# Creating a parcel delivery system (UTM)

involves multiple steps to ensure that it is efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. Here are the key steps in creating a parcel system:



## 1. Define the project scope: 

Identify the number of parcels, destinations, and users that will be using the system. Determine the level of complexity and resources required for the project.

## 2. Identify the stakeholders:

Determine who will be using the system, including shippers, carriers, and recipients. Understand their needs and requirements to ensure that the system meets their expectations. Gather information from OPC, CPP and students(Recipients).
- User requirements.

  - Integration with the university system: The delivery service system should be integrated with the university's existing systems, such as the student information system, to ensure that the delivery addresses and contact information are accurate and up-to-date.

  - Secure and confidential delivery: The system should provide secure and confidential delivery to ensure that only the intended recipient receives the package.

  - Flexible delivery options: The system should provide flexible delivery options to accommodate different types of packages and delivery needs, including same-day and next-day delivery, scheduled deliveries, and pick-up options.

  - Real-time tracking and notifications: The system should provide real-time tracking and notifications to keep the recipient informed about the delivery status and estimated delivery time.

  - Efficient and reliable delivery: The system should provide efficient and reliable delivery to ensure that packages are delivered on time and in good condition.

  - User-friendly interface: The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, especially for students who may be unfamiliar with the system.

  - Integration with mobile devices: The system should be accessible through mobile devices, allowing students to track their packages on-the-go.

  - Payment options: The system should provide flexible payment options, including payment through the student's university account or other payment methods.

  - Responsive customer support: The system should provide responsive customer support, including a help desk, chat support, or email support, to assist with any issues or questions.

- System requirements.

  - Scalability: The system should be able to handle a high volume of package deliveries, especially during peak times, such as the start and end of the semester.

  - Reliability: The system should be reliable and available 24/7 to ensure that students can access the system and track their packages at any time.

  - Security: The system should have robust security features to protect student and staff data, including encryption, firewalls, and secure login credentials.

  - Integration: The system should be easily integrated with the university's existing systems, such as the student information system and payment processing system.

  - Mobile optimization: The system should be optimized for mobile devices, allowing students to access the system and track their packages from their smartphones and tablets.

  - Real-time tracking: The system should provide real-time tracking information to students and staff, including package location, delivery status, and estimated delivery time.

  - Automated notifications: The system should provide automated notifications to students and staff, including email or text message alerts, when packages are ready for pick-up or delivery.

  - Payment processing: The system should integrate with the university's payment processing system to allow for seamless payment processing and tracking.

  - Data analysis: The system should provide data analysis and reporting capabilities to track package delivery performance, identify areas for improvement, and provide insights to university administrators.

## 3. Define the system requirements:

Determine the features and functionality required for the system, such as parcel tracking, payment processing, and delivery options. Consider the user interface, security, integration with other systems, scalability, performance, and maintenance requirements.

## 4. Choose a technology platform:

Select a technology platform for the system, including the programming language, database, and web server. Ensure that the technology platform is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain.

## 5. Design the system architecture:

Design the system architecture, including the database, user interface, and system components. Ensure that the architecture is scalable, secure, and follows best practices.

## 6. Develop and test the system:

Develop the system using a software development life cycle (SDLC) methodology. Test the system thoroughly before deployment to ensure that it meets the stakeholders' needs and requirements.

## 7. Deploy and maintain the system:

Deploy the system to the production environment. Maintain and update the system regularly to ensure that it continues to meet the stakeholders' needs and requirements.

## 8. Establish partnerships with carriers and payment providers:

Establish partnerships with carriers to ensure reliable delivery services and payment providers to process payments securely and efficiently.

## 9. Implement effective parcel tracking:

Implement an effective parcel tracking system to enable shippers and recipients to track their parcels' status in real-time.

## 10. Monitor and improve system performance:

Continuously monitor the system performance, identify areas of improvement, and implement changes to enhance the system's performance.



In summary, creating a parcel system requires a comprehensive approach that involves understanding the needs of the stakeholders, defining the system requirements, choosing a technology platform, designing the system architecture, developing and testing the system, deploying and maintaining the system, establishing partnerships with carriers and payment providers, implementing effective parcel tracking, and monitoring and improving system performance. By following these key steps, you can ensure that the parcel system is efficient, reliable, and cost-effective, meeting the needs of all stakeholders.
