# Syntax
PlantUML provides a simple and intuitive syntax for creating UML diagrams. The syntax is based on a text-based markup language that allows you to describe the various elements of a UML diagram using a series of keywords, symbols, and characters.

To create a UML diagram using PlantUML, you start by specifying the type of diagram you want to create (e.g. "class", "sequence", "usecase", etc.) using a keyword. You then use a combination of symbols and characters to define the various elements of the diagram.

| No. | Name| Description|
| --- | -----------------| ----------------------------------|
| 1| Sequence diagram | Depicts interactions between objects over time. |
| 2| Use case diagram | Shows the relationships between actors and use cases in a system.|
| 3| Class diagram | Describes the structure of classes and their relationships.|
| 4| Object diagram| Shows a snapshot of objects and their relationships at a particular point in time. |
| 5| Activity diagram | Illustrates the flow of activities in a system.|
| 6| Component diagram| Illustrates the structure of components and their relationships.|
| 7| Deployment diagram| Shows the physical deployment of components in a system.|
| 8| State diagram | Describes the behavior of objects in response to events.|
| 9| Timing diagram| Shows the timing constraints of interactions between objects.|
