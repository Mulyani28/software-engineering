## 6. Goal
The goal of a delivery service system for a university is to provide a convenient, reliable, and efficient way for students, faculty, and staff to send and receive packages within the university campus or surrounding area. The system aims to simplify the package delivery process, reduce the burden of package management on university staff, and improve the overall experience for package senders and recipients.

By implementing a delivery service system, the university can enhance its reputation as a student-focused institution that prioritizes the needs and convenience of its students. The system can also help to reduce package theft, loss, and damage by providing secure package storage and tracking.

Additionally, the delivery service system can save time and resources for university staff who would otherwise need to manage package deliveries manually. With the help of a delivery service system, staff can focus on other important tasks while ensuring that packages are delivered efficiently and reliably.

Overall, the goal of a delivery service system for a university is to provide a convenient and efficient solution to package delivery that meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff while enhancing the reputation and efficiency of the university.
