# Part 3: Structural Models

In software engineering, structural models are used to represent the internal structure of a software system. These models are typically created during the design phase of software development and help developers to understand the relationships between different components of the system.

There are several types of structural models used in software engineering, including:

1. Class diagrams: A class diagram is a type of structural model that shows the classes, interfaces, and their relationships in a software system. It helps developers to understand the structure of the system and the interactions between different objects.

2. Object diagrams: An object diagram is a type of structural model that shows the objects and their relationships in a particular instance of a software system. It helps developers to understand the interactions between objects at runtime.

3. Component diagrams: A component diagram is a type of structural model that shows the components of a software system and the dependencies between them. It helps developers to understand how the different components of the system work together to achieve the system's functionality.

4. Deployment diagrams: A deployment diagram is a type of structural model that shows the physical deployment of a software system, including the hardware and software components, and their relationships. It helps developers to understand how the system will be deployed and configured in the production environment.

5. Package diagrams: A package diagram is a type of structural model that shows the organization of the software system into packages and the dependencies between them. It helps developers to understand how the different packages of the system are related and how they work together to achieve the system's functionality.

Overall, structural models are important in software engineering as they help developers to understand the structure of a software system and how the different components of the system work together to achieve the system's functionality.
