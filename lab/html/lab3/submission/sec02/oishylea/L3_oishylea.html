		<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General
        revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of
        critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

		<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most
        crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines
        impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the
        agency's inception in 1947.</p>

		<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never
        know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
		
        <ul>
		<li>the Cold War</li>
		<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
		<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
