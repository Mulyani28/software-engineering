# Software Requirements Document (SRD): PSZ library management system

The Software Requirements Document (SRD) is an essential document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of a software project. In the case of a library management system, the SRD should define the key features and functionalities that the system should have, as well as any constraints or limitations that may impact the system's design and implementation. The following are some key steps in creating an SRD for a library management system:

1.Define the purpose of the system: The first step in creating an SRD is to define the purpose and objectives of the library management system. This could include a description of the target audience, such as librarians and library users, and the specific tasks that the system should support, such as cataloging, lending, and tracking books.

2.Identify the key features and functionalities: Based on the purpose of the system, identify the key features and functionalities that the system should have. This could include features such as book search, checkout and return, fine calculation, book reservation, and inventory management.

3.Define the user requirements: Define the user requirements, including any user interface requirements, security requirements, and accessibility requirements. This could include specifying the user roles, login requirements, password policies, and accessibility features such as text-to-speech and font size adjustment.

4.Define the system requirements: Define the system requirements, including any hardware, software, and network requirements. This could include specifying the minimum and recommended system specifications, such as processor speed, memory, and network bandwidth.

5.Define the performance requirements: Define the performance requirements, including any response time, throughput, and availability requirements. This could include specifying the expected system response time, maximum concurrent users, and system uptime requirements.

6.Define the data requirements: Define the data requirements, including any data models, data structures, and data storage requirements. This could include specifying the data elements and their attributes, data relationships, and data storage requirements.

7.Define the testing requirements: Define the testing requirements, including any testing methodologies, test cases, and acceptance criteria. This could include specifying the functional and non-functional testing requirements, and the expected test results.

8.Define the deployment requirements: Define the deployment requirements, including any installation, configuration, and training requirements. This could include specifying the deployment environment, installation procedures, and training materials.

By following these key steps, you can create a comprehensive SRD that outlines the requirements of your library management system, and serves as a basis for the system design and implementation.

Requirements Engineering is a systematic approach used to elicit, analyze, specify, validate, and manage the requirements of a software system. The goal of requirements engineering is to ensure that the final software product meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, including customers, users, and developers.The process of requirements engineering involves a range of activities, including:

1.Elicitation: Gathering information about the system requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and other techniques.

2.Analysis: Examining the collected requirements to identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and conflicts. This step involves modeling the system and its requirements using diagrams, such as use case diagrams and entity-relationship diagrams.

3.Specification: Documenting the system requirements in a clear and unambiguous way, typically using a Requirements Specification document.

4.Validation: Checking that the requirements accurately capture the stakeholders' needs and that they can be implemented within the available resources.

5.Management: Tracking changes to the requirements, assessing their impact, and ensuring that they are incorporated into the final product.

Effective requirements engineering is critical to the success of a software project. Poorly defined or incomplete requirements can lead to cost overruns, missed deadlines, and dissatisfied customers. By contrast, a well-executed requirements engineering process can improve communication among stakeholders, reduce development time, and increase the likelihood of delivering a system that meets the stakeholders' needs.
