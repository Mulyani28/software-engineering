# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Campus Management System

## Key steps in creating an Campus Management System
Developing an campus management system for a university involves several key steps:

### 1. System requirements gathering
The first step in developing a campus management system is to gather requirements from stakeholders such as students, faculty members, and university administrators. This involves identifying the key features and functionalities that are required for the system to meet the needs of these stakeholders. Some of the key requirements for a campus management system may include course catalog, course registration, scheduling, waitlist management, grade management, student information management, billing and financial management, library management, and hostel management. The requirements should be documented in a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

### 2. System design
Once the requirements are gathered, the next step is to design the system. This involves creating a high-level system architecture that outlines the different components of the system and how they interact with each other. The system design should also include a detailed database design that specifies the data models and relationships between different entities in the system. Finally, the user interface design should be created that defines how users will interact with the system.

### 3. System development
After the system design is finalized, the actual development of the system can begin. This involves writing code using programming languages, frameworks, and tools that are best suited for the requirements of the system. The development process should follow a structured approach that includes version control, code reviews, and testing at each stage of development.

### 4. System testing
Once the system is developed, it needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected. This involves conducting various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Testing should be done for all possible scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

### 5. System deployment
After the system is tested and approved, it needs to be deployed on the university's servers or cloud infrastructure. The deployment process should be carefully planned and executed to ensure minimal disruption to the normal operations of the university. Once the system is deployed, it should be closely monitored for performance and availability.

### 6. System maintenance
Finally, the system needs to be maintained and updated to ensure that it continues to meet the evolving needs of the university. This involves fixing bugs, adding new features, and making updates to the system to keep it up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. System maintenance should be done on a regular basis to ensure that the system remains reliable, secure, and efficient.

## Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the requirements for a software system. In the context of an academic course registration system, the requirements engineering process is crucial for ensuring that the system meets the needs of its stakeholders, including students, faculty members, and university administrators.

The requirements engineering process for an academic course registration system typically involves the following steps:

### 1. Requirements elicitation
The first step in Requirements Engineering is to elicit the requirements for the campus management system. This involves identifying and gathering the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, such as students, faculty members, and university administrators. This can be done through techniques such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, and workshops.

### 2. Requirements analysis
Once the requirements are elicited, they need to be analyzed to identify any conflicts, ambiguities, or missing information. This involves creating a requirements model that describes the functionality of the system and the relationships between the requirements. The requirements model can be created using techniques such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and data flow diagrams.

### 3. Requirements specification
AAfter the requirements are analyzed, they need to be specified in a clear and concise manner. This involves creating a requirements document that describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. The requirements document should also include any assumptions and constraints that were identified during the requirements elicitation and analysis phases

### 4. Requirements validation
Once the requirements are specified, they need to be validated to ensure that they meet the needs of the stakeholders and are feasible to implement. This involves reviewing the requirements document with the stakeholders to get their feedback and to identify any errors or omissions. The requirements should also be checked for consistency, completeness, and verifiability.

### 5. Requirements management
Requirements Engineering is an iterative process, and as such, the requirements need to be managed throughout the lifecycle of the project. This involves tracking changes to the requirements, ensuring that they are properly prioritized, and communicating any changes to the stakeholders. The requirements should also be reviewed periodically to ensure that they are still valid and relevant to the needs of the stakeholders.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders in an campus management system can be broadly categorized into four groups:

### 1. Students
They are the primary users of the system and are interested in features such as course registration, grade management, and access to their personal information.

### 2. University administrators 
They use the system to manage and oversee academic operations, including course offerings, scheduling, and student records.

### 3. Registrar's office 
They manage student registration, waitlist management, and transcript processing, and are key stakeholders in the campus management system.

### 4. Support staff
They use the system to manage administrative tasks such as scheduling, room assignments, and student support.

# User and System Requirement

## User Requirements:
### 1.Students: 
Students should be able to view and search for courses, register for classes, add/drop courses, view their schedules, view their grades, access their personal information, and pay their tuition and fees.

### 2.Faculty Members: 
Faculty members should be able to view their course schedule, manage their course materials, upload and grade assignments, view their students' grades and attendance, communicate with students, and access their personal information.

### 3.Administrators: 
Administrators should be able to manage course offerings, manage faculty and student information, generate reports, manage financial transactions, manage campus resources, and view system usage statistics.

### 4.Staff Members: 
Staff members should be able to manage student information, manage enrollment and registration, manage course materials, manage campus resources, and view system usage statistics.

## System Requirements:
Course Catalog: The system should provide a comprehensive and up-to-date catalog of courses offered at the university, including course descriptions, schedules, prerequisites, and availability.

### 1.Course Registration: 
The system should allow students to search and register for courses, manage their course selections, view their schedule, and manage waitlists.

### 2.Scheduling: 
The system should generate and manage schedules for courses, classrooms, and faculty members, taking into account class size, availability, and other constraints.

### 3. Grade Management: 
The system should allow faculty members to enter and manage grades for their students, and allow students to view their grades.
