| 1 | Project Proposal|A project proposal is a detailed document that outlines a proposed project's goals, scope, activities, deliverables, and proposed duration. The introduction should be neat, organized, and written in clear language, with a description of the project's main goal and scope. The software process model (SPM) used for the project should be explained along with the reason for its selection. An illustration of the SPM should be provided to help readers understand how it will be used in the project. Finally, the proposal should include detailed activities, deliverables, and proposed duration for each phase of the project. The proposal must also consider the feasibility of the project, the resources required, and any potential risks.|<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod1.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| <a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec02/mod1.md" ><img src="./images/markdownh.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
