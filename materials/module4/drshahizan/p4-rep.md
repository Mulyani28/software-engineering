# Part 4: Form-Based Specifications

Form-based specifications, also known as tabular specifications, are another way to document system requirements in a structured format. This approach involves organizing requirements into tables with columns representing different aspects of the requirement, such as the requirement identifier, description, priority, and so on. Each row in the table represents a single requirement.

Here is an example of a form-based specification for a requirement in an academic course registration system:

| Requirement ID | CR-001 |
| --- | --- |
| Requirement Description | The system shall allow students to view their course schedules |
| Priority | High |
| Source | Student |
| Rationale | Students need to be able to access their schedules to keep track of their classes and plan their time |
| Acceptance Criteria | The system should display a clear and concise schedule that includes course titles, times, and locations |
| Dependencies | None |

In this example, the requirement ID is "CR-001", which identifies the requirement in the overall list of requirements. The requirement description states what the system should do, which is to allow students to view their course schedules. The priority of this requirement is "High", indicating its importance. The source of the requirement is the student, meaning that the requirement is driven by the needs of the student. The rationale explains why this requirement is necessary, which is to help students keep track of their classes and plan their time. The acceptance criteria specify how the system should fulfill the requirement, which is by displaying a clear and concise schedule that includes course titles, times, and locations. Finally, the dependencies column indicates if there are any other requirements that this requirement depends on.

Form-based specifications can be useful because they provide a clear and structured way to document requirements, making them easier to understand and manage. They can also help ensure that all necessary information is included for each requirement, such as its rationale and acceptance criteria.
