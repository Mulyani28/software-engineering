Requirements engineering is a systematic process for defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in a software development project. Here are some steps that can be followed for the requirements engineering process for a Badal Hajj and Umrah management system:

### 1. Identify stakeholders: 
The first step is to identify all the stakeholders who will be impacted by the system, including the management, agents, and the pilgrims themselves. It is important to involve all relevant stakeholders in the requirements engineering process to ensure that all their needs are taken into account.

### 2. Gather and analyze requirements: 
The second step is to gather and analyze the requirements from all the stakeholders. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other methods. The requirements should be documented in a clear and concise manner, using a standard format.

### 3. Prioritize requirements: 
Once all the requirements have been gathered, they should be prioritized based on their importance and feasibility. This will help the development team to focus on the most critical and achievable requirements first.

### 4. Create use cases: 
Use cases are a useful tool for documenting how the system will be used by the stakeholders. Use cases should be created for each major function of the system, and they should be reviewed and validated by the stakeholders.

### 5. Prototype and iterate: 
Once the requirements have been documented and prioritized, the development team should create a prototype of the system. This prototype should be used to validate the requirements and to identify any gaps or issues that need to be addressed. The development team should iterate on the prototype until all the requirements have been fully met.

### 6. Document and maintain requirements: 
Finally, all the requirements should be documented and maintained throughout the development process. Any changes or updates to the requirements should be documented and communicated to all stakeholders. This will help to ensure that the system meets the needs of all the stakeholders and is delivered on time and within budget.


## Stakeholders
Stakeholders in an academic course registration system can be broadly categorized into three groups:

### 1. Students
Students are the primary users of the course registration system. They need to be able to search for courses, register for classes, drop or swap classes, and view their schedules. They also need to be able to view their grades and academic records.

### 2. Faculty Members
Faculty members are responsible for managing their courses and grading students. They need to be able to view their course rosters, submit grades, and communicate with students. They may also need to view student records to identify any academic issues.

### 3. University Administrators
University administrators are responsible for managing the overall academic operations of the university. They need to be able to monitor course availability, manage course scheduling and capacity, and view student enrollment data. They may also need to view student records for reporting and compliance purposes.

Other stakeholders may include academic advisors, department chairs, and IT staff who are responsible for maintaining and updating the course registration system.

Understanding the needs and requirements of these stakeholders is crucial for designing a course registration system that is user-friendly, efficient, and meets the academic needs of the university. It is important to involve stakeholders in the requirements gathering and validation process to ensure that the system meets their expectations and addresses their pain points.

## Users and system requirements
Users and system requirements are two different aspects of an academic course registration system, and it is important to understand the differences between them.

### User requirements
Users refer to the people who will be using the system, including students, faculty members, and university administrators. They have specific needs, preferences, and expectations from the system, and their requirements are often expressed in terms of user stories, scenarios, or use cases. For example, a student may require the ability to search for courses by department, instructor, or time of day, while a faculty member may require the ability to view student transcripts or communicate with their class via email.

### System requirements
System requirements, on the other hand, refer to the technical and functional specifications of the system. They describe what the system must do, and are often expressed in terms of features, capabilities, and constraints. For example, the system may need to be able to handle a certain number of concurrent users, have robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and integrate with other university systems such as the student information system or the learning management system.

While user requirements and system requirements are distinct, they are closely related, and it is important to ensure that they are aligned. The system requirements should be designed to meet the needs and expectations of the system's users, and the user requirements should be prioritized and translated into specific system requirements. By understanding both users and system requirements, designers and developers can create a course registration system that meets the needs of its stakeholders while being technically sound and reliable.
