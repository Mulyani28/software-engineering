- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
[- The risk assessment section identifies and assesses any potential risks that could impact the project, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or changes in project requirements. 
- It should also describe the plans and strategies to mitigate those risks.]

| Potential Risks | Plan / Strategies |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| *Technical challenges* - There may be technical challenges realated to coding, server management, website security, and also database management. These challenges could result in delays, additional costs, or errors in the website's functionality. | Conduct a thorough analysis of the website's technical requirements and ensure that the team has the necessary skills and expertise to handle technical challenges. Develop a contingency plan for potential technical issues that could impact the project timeline and budget.|
| *Resource constraints* - This project may require significant resources in terms of time, money, and personnel. Resource constriants sich as a lack of funding could impact the project's timeline or quality. | Making a plan to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize tasks based on thier importance to the project's success. Furthermore, we would consider an alternative approaches such as outsourcing or partnering with other organizations to supplement resources. |
| *Changes in project requirements* - It may change over time, such as addition of new features or changes in the website's design or target audience. This changes could result in additional costs and delays as our team adjusts the project plan. | Communicate changes effectively with the all stakeholders and assess the impact of changes on the project timeline and budget. And also, review and update the project plan regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the project requirements. |
| *Cybersecurity risks* - A student engagement website may collect sensitive information such as students' email, course information, and address. Cybersecurity risks such as hacking or data breaches could compromise this information and harm the reputation of our project and the institution.| By developing and implement cybersecurity measures to protect the website and user data, conduct regular vulnerability assessments and address any security issue promptly can make sure user's information stay protected. |
| *user adoption* - If students and faculty do not use the website as intended, this project may fail to meet the goals. | Conduct user testing and gather feedback throughout the development process. Second, promote and provide support to encourage user adoption and address any ussues that arise. |

### 9. Resources:

### 10. Technical Specifications:
The student engagement system proposed will require the following technical specifications:

#### Data Sources:
- Student data from the university's student management system
- Engagement data from various sources, such as clubs and faculties

#### Data Schema:
The data schema will consist of multiple tables that store information about students, faculties, clubs, and engagement metrics. The schema will be designed to facilitate the extraction of meaningful insights through machine learning algorithms.

#### Data Transformations:
Data transformations will be performed to clean, preprocess, and prepare the data for analysis. These transformations may include data imputation, normalization, feature engineering, and data aggregation.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms:
Machine learning algorithms may still be used to analyze the data and extract insights about student engagement patterns. However, in a PHP-based system, the machine learning algorithms may be implemented as external services or libraries that are called from the PHP code.

#### Data Visualization Tools:
Data visualization tools such as Chart.js, D3.js, or Google Charts may be used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that enable stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights.

#### Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries:
The project will be implemented using PHP as the primary programming language, and various web development frameworks and libraries, such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, Bootstrap, and jQuery, will be used to build the user interface, handle HTTP requests, and manage the database.

#### Hardware and Software Requirements:
The hardware and software requirements for the system will depend on the number of users and the complexity of the system. A web server running PHP and a database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, will be required. The server should have enough memory and processing power to handle multiple concurrent requests.

#### Data Security Measures:
To ensure data security and privacy, access to the data will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Data encryption and secure data transmission protocols will be implemented to protect data at rest and in transit. All data will be stored in secure servers with regular backups and access logs. SQL injection prevention measures will also be implemented to prevent malicious attacks.
