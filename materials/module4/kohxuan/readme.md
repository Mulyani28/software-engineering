# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management 

## Key steps in creating an Student Health and Wellness Management 

Designing and implementing a Student Health and Wellness Management System involves several key steps:

### 1. Identify Requirements: 
The first step in creating a Student Health and Wellness Management System is to identify the requirements of the system. This includes identifying the needs of students, such as the ability to manage their medical records, schedule appointments with healthcare providers, and sign up for wellness activities.

### 2. Design the System Architecture: 
Once the requirements have been identified, the next step is to design the system architecture. This involves defining the structure of the system, including the databases, user interface, and integration with other systems such as electronic health record systems and campus information systems.

### 3. Develop the System: 
After the system architecture has been designed, the development phase begins. This involves coding the system, integrating it with other systems, and conducting testing to ensure that it is functioning as intended.

### 4. Implement the System: 
Once the system has been developed and tested, it is time to implement it. This involves deploying the system, training users on how to use it, and ensuring that it is integrated with other systems.

### 5. Monitor and Maintain the System: 
After the system has been implemented, it is important to monitor its performance and maintain it. This involves conducting regular updates and addressing any issues that arise.

### 6. Evaluate the System: 
Finally, it is important to evaluate the system to determine its effectiveness. This includes analyzing user feedback and system usage data to identify areas for improvement and make any necessary changes.

## Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. In the context of a Student Health and Wellness Management System, the requirements engineering process involves identifying the needs of students and healthcare providers, and defining the features and functionality of the system to meet those needs.

The following are some key steps in the requirements engineering process for a Student Health and Wellness Management System:

### 1. Elicitation of Requirements: 
This involves gathering information from various stakeholders, such as students, healthcare providers, and administrators, about the needs and requirements of the system. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other techniques.

### 2. Analysis of Requirements: 
Once the requirements have been elicited, they need to be analyzed to identify any conflicts, inconsistencies, or ambiguities. This involves refining and prioritizing the requirements to ensure they are aligned with the goals of the system.

### 3. Documentation of Requirements: 
The requirements must be documented in a clear and concise manner to ensure they are understood by all stakeholders. This may involve creating use cases, user stories, or other types of requirement specifications.

### 4. Validation of Requirements: 
The requirements must be validated to ensure they are complete, accurate, and meet the needs of the stakeholders. This may involve conducting reviews, walkthroughs, or simulations of the system to ensure it meets the requirements.

### 5. Management of Requirements: 
As the system evolves, it is important to manage the requirements to ensure they remain up-to-date and aligned with the needs of the stakeholders. This may involve tracking changes to the requirements, managing requirements traceability, and conducting impact analysis of changes to the requirements.

In summary, requirements engineering is a critical process for the successful development of a Student Health and Wellness Management System. It ensures that the system meets the needs of the stakeholders, is aligned with the goals of the system, and is well-documented and validated.
