### 1. Executive Summary
Our proposed UTM Event Management System is a comprehensive solution aimed at simplifying and streamlining the processes of event management for organisers, attendees, and administrators. To achieve this, we are utilising advanced technologies and industry best practices to provide a seamless user experience that enables organisers to plan and execute successful events with ease, and attendees to easily discover, register and participate in events. The key features of our system include real-time event scheduling, registration, various types of activities and merit, and feedback capabilities, which give organisers and administrators the ability to optimise event planning, monitor performance, and make informed data-driven decisions. Attendees will also benefit from a user-friendly interface, as well as integration with various social media platforms. Ultimately, our UTM Event Management System will provide measurable value to all stakeholders, resulting in increased event participation, better engagement and satisfaction, and a stronger institutional reputation. By investing in our system, UTM will be at the forefront of event management technology and innovation.

### 2. Background:
Events are an essential part of the University of Technology, Malaysia (UTM) experience. However, the current manual process of managing events is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks the ability to provide real-time information about event performance. These challenges have resulted in poor event planning, low participation rates, and a negative impact on the overall experience of attendees.

The proposed UTM Event Management System aims to address these challenges by introducing an innovative, intuitive, and automated system that streamlines the event management process. The proposed system leverages the latest technologies and industry best practices to deliver a seamless user experience for organisers, attendees, and administrators. Key features of the system include  real-time event scheduling, registration, various types of activities and merit, and feedback capabilities, which give organisers and administrators the ability to optimise event planning, monitor performance, and make informed data-driven decisions.

The proposed UTM Event Management System has the potential to significantly improve the overall experience for all stakeholders, including organisers, attendees, and administrators. By reducing the administrative burden of manual processes, the proposed system will save time, reduce errors, and increase satisfaction. Additionally, the system will provide valuable insights and analytics that can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve event outcomes. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to position UTM as a leader in event management technology and innovation and improve its competitive edge in attracting and retaining attendees.

In summary, the UTM Event Management System proposal seeks to address the challenges associated with the current manual event management process by introducing a modern, automated, and user-friendly solution that provides measurable benefits and enhances the overall experience of all stakeholders. The proposed system has the potential to transform event management at UTM, improve event outcomes, and enhance UTM's reputation as a leading institution of higher learning.


### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
The development of the academic course registration system for 30,000 users within a year will involve various costs, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. The budget for this project is estimated at RM 1,300,000, as outlined below:

- **Hardware Costs: RM 400,000** <br>
This includes the cost of servers, storage, networking equipment, and other hardware required to support the system. This cost will vary depending on the specific hardware configuration chosen, but it is essential to ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users and data volume.

- **Software Costs: RM 150,000** <br>
This includes the cost of licences for any third-party software required, such as operating systems, databases, and development tools. It also includes the cost of any software development needed for the project, such as custom modules or integrations.

- **Personnel Costs: RM 324,000** <br>
This includes the cost of the development team, project managers, and quality assurance specialists. The team size and composition will vary depending on the complexity of the project, but it is essential to ensure that the team has the necessary skills and experience to complete the project on time and within budget.
Testing Costs: RM 76,000
This includes the cost of testing the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. This cost will depend on the testing approach chosen, such as manual or automated testing.

- **Other Expenses: RM 250,000** <br>
This includes the cost of rent for office space, utilities, marketing and advertising, and testing.

- **Contingency Plan: RM 100,000** <br>
It is always recommended to have a contingency plan for unexpected expenses that may arise during the project. This can include budget reserves or adjusting the scope of the project if necessary.

In conclusion, the estimated budget for the development of the UTM Event Management System is RM 1,300,000. The budget will cover the costs associated with hardware, software, personnel, testing, and contingency. Any changes in the budget will be communicated to stakeholders and project sponsors.
