# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management


## Developing a Student Health and Wellness Management system for a university involves several key steps. Here's a general outline of the process:

### 1.  Planning and Requirements Gathering: 
This stage involves identifying the stakeholders and gathering the requirements for the system, including functional and non-functional requirements, user requirements, system integration requirements, and legal and regulatory requirements.

### 2.  System Design: 
This stage involves designing the architecture of the system, including the data model, data flow, user interface, and system integration.

### 3.  System Development: 
This stage involves developing the system software and database, as well as integrating the system with other existing systems and testing the system for quality assurance.

### 4.  User Acceptance Testing: 
This stage involves testing the system with actual users to ensure that it meets the user's requirements, is user-friendly, and functions as expected.

### 5.  Deployment: 
This stage involves installing the system and making it available to users, including training and support for users.

### 6.  Maintenance and Support: 
This stage involves maintaining the system, monitoring for bugs, and providing support to users as needed.

### 7.  System Evaluation: 
This stage involves evaluating the system's performance and effectiveness in meeting the goals and objectives, as well as making improvements as needed based on user feedback and changes in regulations and standards.

Overall, developing a Student Health and Wellness Management System for a university requires a well-defined process that involves thorough planning, requirements gathering, system design, system development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and evaluation to ensure that the system meets the needs of the stakeholders and achieves its goals.
