| Week | Module | Description | 01 | 02 |
| :-----: | ------ | ------ | :-----: | :-----: |
| 1 | Project Proposal|A project proposal is a detailed document that outlines a proposed project's goals, scope, activities, deliverables, and proposed duration. The introduction should be neat, organized, and written in clear language, with a description of the project's main goal and scope. The software process model (SPM) used for the project should be explained along with the reason for its selection. An illustration of the SPM should be provided to help readers understand how it will be used in the project. Finally, the proposal should include detailed activities, deliverables, and proposed duration for each phase of the project. The proposal must also consider the feasibility of the project, the resources required, and any potential risks.|<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod1.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| <a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec02/mod1.md" ><img src="./images/markdownh.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 2 | Proposal Rubric | A rubric for evaluating a project proposal should include criteria such as neatness, organization, and language in the introduction section. The goal and scope of the project should also be clearly defined in the introduction. The proposal should explain the software process model (SPM) selected for the project and provide a reasoning for its selection. An illustration of the SPM should be included in the proposal. The proposal should also detail the activities, deliverables, and proposed duration for each phase of the project, while considering the feasibility, resources required, and potential risks. The rubric should also assess the proposal's adherence to the required guidelines and the quality of its writing. |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod2.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| <a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec02/mod2.md" ><img src="./images/markdownh.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 3 | System Documentation (SD) | System Documentation (SD) should provide the details of the entire document comprising System Requirements Specification (SRS), System Design Document (SDD), and System Testing Document (STD). Remove the notes in read texts when submitting including these notes. For this Assignment 2, you are required to submit the partial SD by completing the SRS part only that covers Section 1.0 and Section 2.0.
