# Software Requirements Document (SRD): University Course Management System
## The development of a University Social Network system involves several key steps:

<b>1. Planning: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the objectives, goals, and scope of the project are defined. The stakeholders and target users are identified, and the features and functionalities of the system are outlined.

<b>2. Analysis: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements of the system are gathered, documented, and analyzed. This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and focus groups with the stakeholders and target users to determine their needs, preferences, and expectations.

<b>3. Design: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the technical and functional specifications of the system are developed. This involves creating the architecture, user interface, and database design of the system.

<b>4. Development: <b/>
<br>
In this stage, the software code of the system is written, tested, and deployed. This involves following the design specifications and coding standards to build a reliable and efficient system.

<b>5. Testing:</b>
<br>
In this stage, the system is thoroughly tested for functionality, usability, and performance. This involves conducting unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure that the system works as expected.

<b>6. Deployment: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the system is installed and made available to the users. This involves configuring the servers, installing the software, and providing user training and support.

<b>7. Maintenance: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the system is regularly monitored and maintained to ensure that it continues to function optimally. This involves fixing bugs, applying security patches, and updating the software to keep it up-to-date.

## Requirements Engineering
The Requirements Engineering process of a University Social Network system involves the following steps:

<b>1. Requirements elicitation: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements of the system are identified by gathering information from stakeholders, users, and other sources.

<b>2. Requirements analysis: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements are analyzed to determine their feasibility, consistency, and completeness. This involves prioritizing the requirements, identifying conflicts, and resolving ambiguities.

<b>3. Requirements specification: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements are documented in a clear and concise manner. This involves creating use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, and other documents to describe the system requirements.

<b>4. Requirements validation: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements are reviewed and validated to ensure that they meet the needs of the stakeholders and users. This involves conducting walkthroughs, inspections, and tests to verify the requirements.
