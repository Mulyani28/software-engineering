### Manage Requirements: 
Once the requirements have been validated, they need to be managed throughout the development process. This involves tracking changes to the requirements, prioritizing them, and ensuring that they are implemented correctly.

### Verify Requirements: 
Finally, the requirements need to be verified to ensure that the accommodation management system meets all of the identified requirements. This involves testing the system against the requirements and making any necessary changes.

In summary, requirement engineering for developing a university accommodation management system involves identifying stakeholders, gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating, managing, and verifying the requirements to ensure that the system meets the needs of all users.

## Stakeholders
Here are some more detailed explanations of the different stakeholders involved in the development and use of a university accommodation management system:

### University Administration:
University administration is a key stakeholder in the accommodation management system. They are responsible for managing the overall operations of the university, including the management of student accommodation. Their requirements for the system may include features such as room allocation, billing and payments, maintenance and repairs, and reporting and analytics.

### Staff: 
University staff such as accommodation managers, maintenance staff, and administrative assistants are also important stakeholders in the system. Their requirements may include access to real-time information about room availability, maintenance requests, and student information. They may also require tools for managing student check-in and check-out, managing room assignments, and generating reports.

### Students: 
Students are the primary users of the accommodation management system, and their needs and preferences should be taken into account when developing the system. Their requirements may include access to real-time information about room availability, the ability to book or cancel a room reservation, online payments, and the ability to submit maintenance requests.

### External Parties: 
xternal parties such as vendors, suppliers, or government agencies may also be involved in the accommodation management system. Their requirements may include integration with external systems, compliance with regulations, and data security and privacy.

In summary, the different stakeholders in a university accommodation management system include university administration, staff, students, and external parties. Each stakeholder has their own unique requirements and needs, and it is important to involve all stakeholders in the requirement engineering process to ensure that the system meets their needs and expectations.

## Users and system requirements
Users and system requirements are two different aspects of an academic course registration system, and it is important to understand the differences between them.

### User requirements
Users refer to the people who will be using the system, including students, faculty members, and university administrators. They have specific needs, preferences, and expectations from the system, and their requirements are often expressed in terms of user stories, scenarios, or use cases. For example, a student may require the ability to search for courses by department, instructor, or time of day, while a faculty member may require the ability to view student transcripts or communicate with their class via email.

### System requirements
System requirements, on the other hand, refer to the technical and functional specifications of the system. They describe what the system must do, and are often expressed in terms of features, capabilities, and constraints. For example, the system may need to be able to handle a certain number of concurrent users, have robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and integrate with other university systems such as the student information system or the learning management system.

While user requirements and system requirements are distinct, they are closely related, and it is important to ensure that they are aligned. The system requirements should be designed to meet the needs and expectations of the system's users, and the user requirements should be prioritized and translated into specific system requirements. By understanding both users and system requirements, designers and developers can create a course registration system that meets the needs of its stakeholders while being technically sound and reliable.
