# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Online Grading System

## Developing an academic registration system for a university requires some steps that you can follow to develop an academic registration system for a university:

### 1. Define the Requirements:
Start by defining the requirements of the registration system, including the features required, the user roles and permissions, and the data that needs to be captured during registration. The features may include student registration, course registration, faculty management, student records management, and reporting.

### 2. Design the System Architecture: 
Once you have defined the requirements, you can start designing the system architecture. Determine the technology stack and the database schema that will be used to build the system. You may also consider whether to use a cloud-based system or an on-premise system.

### 3. Develop the System: 
After defining the requirements and system architecture, you can start developing the system. Start with building the core functionality of the registration system and then move on to the user interface. Ensure that the system is secure and scalable.

### 4. Test and Debug: 
Once the system is developed, it is important to thoroughly test and debug it. Conduct various types of testing such as functional testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure that the system meets the requirements and is error-free.

### 5. Deploy the System: 
Once testing is complete, deploy the system to the production environment. Ensure that the system is backed up regularly and that appropriate security measures are in place to protect student data.

### 6. Maintain and Update the System: 
Finally, maintain and update the system as necessary to ensure that it remains functional and up-to-date with changing requirements and technologies.



By following these steps, you can develop an academic registration system for a university that meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff while ensuring the security and integrity of student data.
