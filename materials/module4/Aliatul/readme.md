  - Payment processing: The system should integrate with the university's payment processing system to allow for seamless payment processing and tracking.

  - Data analysis: The system should provide data analysis and reporting capabilities to track package delivery performance, identify areas for improvement, and provide insights to university administrators.
 
## 4. Functional requirements
Describe the specific features and functions that a delivery service system for a university must have to meet the needs of its users.

- User registration : The system should allow users to register for the service by providing their personal information and delivery address.

- Package tracking : The system should allow users to track the status of their packages in real-time, including package location and estimated delivery time.

- Delivery scheduling : The system should allow users to schedule deliveries at a convenient time and date.

- Package pickup : The system should allow users to schedule package pickup at designated locations on campus.

- Payment processing : The system should allow users to pay for the delivery service using various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, or university accounts.

- Package size and weight limits : The system should have a limit on package size and weight to ensure that packages can be handled safely and efficiently.

- Package handling procedures : The system should have specific handling procedures for fragile, hazardous, or perishable packages.

- User feedback : The system should allow users to provide feedback on the delivery service, including the quality of the delivery, the timeliness of the service, and the professionalism of the delivery personnel.

- Package storage and security : The system should provide secure storage for packages until they are picked up or delivered to the recipient.

- Delivery personnel tracking : The system should allow administrators to track the location of delivery personnel and monitor their delivery activities.

## 5. Non Functional requirements
Describe the characteristics that a delivery service system for a university must have to perform effectively and efficiently. Here are some non-functional requirements that a delivery service system for a university should consider:

  - Performance: The system should be able to handle a large volume of requests and data processing within a reasonable time frame.

  - Availability: The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime for maintenance or upgrades.

  - Reliability: The system should be reliable and ensure the delivery of packages on time with minimal errors.

  - Security: The system should have strong security measures to ensure the protection of user data, including encryption, authentication, and authorization.

  - Scalability: The system should be able to accommodate an increasing number of users and packages without affecting performance.

  - Usability: The system should be easy to use and navigate for both users and administrators.

  - Accessibility: The system should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

  - Compatibility: The system should be compatible with various devices, platforms, and web browsers.

  - Maintainability: The system should be easy to maintain and upgrade with minimal disruption to users.

  - Compliance: The system should comply with relevant regulations and standards, such as data privacy laws and industry standards.

## 6. Goal
The goal of a delivery service system for a university is to provide a convenient, reliable, and efficient way for students, faculty, and staff to send and receive packages within the university campus or surrounding area. The system aims to simplify the package delivery process, reduce the burden of package management on university staff, and improve the overall experience for package senders and recipients.

By implementing a delivery service system, the university can enhance its reputation as a student-focused institution that prioritizes the needs and convenience of its students. The system can also help to reduce package theft, loss, and damage by providing secure package storage and tracking.

Additionally, the delivery service system can save time and resources for university staff who would otherwise need to manage package deliveries manually. With the help of a delivery service system, staff can focus on other important tasks while ensuring that packages are delivered efficiently and reliably.

Overall, the goal of a delivery service system for a university is to provide a convenient and efficient solution to package delivery that meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff while enhancing the reputation and efficiency of the university.
