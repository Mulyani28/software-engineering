- The academic consultation system proposed in this project proposal has the potential to revolutionize the consultation process in academic institutions. The system's   comprehensive features and functionalities will benefit both students and faculty, resulting in enhanced outcomes and improved satisfaction. This system will make     the academic advisor more close to student. Our project team is confident that the proposed system will meet the needs of academic institutions and their      stakeholders, and we look forward to its implementation and success.

### 2. Background:

   An academic consultation system is a software application or platform that provides academic support  services to students, researchers, and faculty members. Such systems can be designed to assist users      with a variety of tasks, including research, writing, editing, proofreading, and formatting of academic papers and assignments.

   The background for an academic consultation system is rooted in the need for academic support services that can help students and researchers improve the quality of their work. Academic consultation systems provide a convenient and efficient way for users to receive feedback and guidance from experts in their field, which can help them to produce better research and academic papers.

   There are a number of different types of academic consultation systems, ranging from online writing centers to virtual tutoring services. These systems may be integrated into a larger learning management system or provided as standalone applications. They can also vary in terms of the level of support they offer, with some providing only basic editing and proofreading services while others offering more extensive feedback and guidance on academic writing.

   The goal of an academic consultation system is to provide users with the tools and resources they need to succeed academically, while also promoting academic integrity and ethical research practices.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
