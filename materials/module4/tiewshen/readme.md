# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student attendance management system
<b>Key steps in creating student attendance management system:</b>

<b>1.Define the scope:</b> Start by defining the scope of the system. What types of attendance do you want to track (e.g., class attendance, event attendance, lab attendance)? What types of reports do you want to generate? What are the key features you want to include in the system?

<b>2.Design the system architecture:</b> Once you have defined the scope of the system, you can start designing the system architecture. This will involve deciding on the programming language, database system, and other tools you will use to build the system.

<b>3.Develop the student database:</b> The first step in building the system is to develop a student database. This database should include information such as student names, student IDs, and class schedules.

<b>4.Implement the attendance tracking system:</b> Once you have developed the student database, you can start implementing the attendance tracking system. This system should allow teachers to mark attendance for each student in their classes. It should also allow students to view their own attendance records.

<b>5.Generate reports:</b> Once the attendance data has been collected, the system should be able to generate reports. Reports can be used to track attendance trends over time, identify students who are frequently absent, and monitor attendance rates for specific classes or events.

<b>6.Add analysis tools:</b> In addition to reports, the system should include analysis tools. These tools can be used to identify patterns in attendance data, such as which classes have the highest attendance rates or which students are most likely to be absent.

<b>7.Test and refine the system:</b> After the system has been developed, it should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is functioning as expected. Any bugs or issues should be addressed, and the system should be refined based on feedback from users.

<b>8.Deploy the system:</b> Once the system has been tested and refined, it can be deployed to the university. Training should be provided to teachers and students to ensure that they understand how to use the system.
