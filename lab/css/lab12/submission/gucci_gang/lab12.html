        Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works.</p></div>
        <p>The school was officially known as Treacher Technical School, named after Sir William Treacher, the Resident General

        School be elevated to a college status and proposed that a new Technical College be constructed. The new college was
        to be built on a 47-acre piece of Government land in Gurney Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the
        construction of the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in Peninsular Malaysia.</p></div>
