# Part 2: Functional requirement

Functional requirements in an academic course registration system specify the system's intended behavior and the tasks that the system must perform to meet the needs of its users. Functional requirements define the features, capabilities, and tasks that the system must be able to perform to achieve its objectives.

Some examples of functional requirements for an academic course registration system might include:

1. **User registration and login**: The system should allow students, faculty members, and university administrators to create and access their accounts with secure login credentials.

2. **Course search and selection**: The system should allow students to search and select courses from a catalog of available courses based on course code, department, instructor, and other relevant criteria.

3. **Course enrollment and waitlisting**: The system should allow students to enroll in courses that are available and add themselves to a waitlist for courses that are currently full.

4. **Course management**: The system should allow faculty members to manage their courses, including adding and removing students, posting course materials, and communicating with students.

5. **Administrative management**: The system should allow university administrators to manage course enrollment data, generate reports, and perform other administrative tasks related to the academic course registration system.

6. **Payment processing**: The system should allow students to pay for their course fees through secure payment gateways and track payment history.

7. **Notifications and alerts**: The system should notify students, faculty members, and university administrators of any updates, changes, or important events related to course registration, enrollment, and management.

By defining these functional requirements, the academic course registration system can be designed and developed to meet the needs and expectations of its users and achieve its objectives. Functional requirements are essential to ensuring that the system performs its intended tasks accurately, efficiently, and reliably.
