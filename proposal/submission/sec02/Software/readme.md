### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Health and Wellness website is a software engineering course project aimed at improving the health and well-being of university students, in cooperation with Pusat Kesihatan University (PKU). The website will provide students with access to a wide range of resources and tools that will help them manage their physical, mental, and emotional health.

The website will be developed using the latest software engineering techniques, and will feature a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Students will be able to access the website from any device, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The website will be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all students can access and use the site.

The Student Health and Wellness website will feature a range of resources, including articles, videos, and podcasts, that cover a variety of topics related to health and wellness. These resources will be developed in collaboration with PKU, ensuring that they are accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the needs of university students.

Overall, the Student Health and Wellness website is an innovative project that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of university students. By providing students with access to accurate information and resources, and by offering tools and services to help them manage their health and wellness, the website will help students achieve their full potential and lead happy, healthy lives.


### 2. Background:
- Process slow and walk in and far for some students.
- More efficient if can pre-booking and can manage more time.
- Pre-online consultation and safe time
- Can give more health information to students and increase health awareness.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- To promote student health and wellness through easy access to medical resources, health tracking tools, and health tips and advice.

(Exampleï¼šBy the end of the first year of implementation, the proposed system will reduce PKU processing time by 25%, resulting in a 25% reduction in administrative workload.)

- To provide a platform for students to communicate with medical professionals at the PKU facility, receive medical advice, and make appointments for medical services.

- To provide a quick and easy way for students to call for emergency assistance in case of a medical emergency.

- To collect and analyze data on student health trends, allowing PKU to better understand the health needs of the student population and provide targeted interventions.


### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
## Presentation Layer:
-User interface design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) <br>
-Content management system (CMS) for managing website content<br>
-Accessibility features to ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities<br>
-Responsive design for optimal display on various devices and screen sizes<br>
## Application Layer:
-Web server (e.g. Apache, Nginx)<br>
-Web application framework (e.g. Django, Ruby on Rails)<br>
-Business logic and data processing code<br>
-Integration with external services (e.g. appointment scheduling, health records)<br>

## Data Layer:
-Relational database management system (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)<br>
-Data schema design and management<br>
-Data access layer (e.g. Object Relational Mapping)<br>
## Security Layer:
-SSL/TLS encryption<br>
-User authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g. OAuth2, LDAP)<br>
-Access control and permission management<br>
-Logging and monitoring for detecting and responding to security incidents<br>
