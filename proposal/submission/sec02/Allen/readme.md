- Access Controls: Access controls should be implemented to restrict access to student data only to authorized personnel. This includes implementing role-based access controls (RBAC), where users are granted access to only the data that they need to perform their job functions. Strong password policies should also be implemented to prevent unauthorized access.

- Secure Communication: All communication between the client and server should be conducted over secure channels, such as HTTPS, to prevent data interception and tampering.

- Regular Data Backups: Regular backups should be taken of the student data and stored in secure locations to ensure that data is not lost in case of a system failure or data corruption.

- System Monitoring: The system should be monitored regularly to detect any security breaches or unusual activity. This includes implementing intrusion detection systems, logging and auditing, and other monitoring tools to detect and respond to security threats.

- Regular Software Updates: Regular software updates should be performed to address any security vulnerabilities or bugs that may be present in the system.

- Employee Training: All employees who have access to student data should be trained on data security best practices, including password hygiene, secure communication, and access control.

By implementing these data security measures, the online grading system can ensure that student data is protected from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse.
