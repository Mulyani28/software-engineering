### 1. Executive Summary
A solution designed to simplify and streamline the process time of PKU for students and administrators.

### 2. Background:
- Process slow and walk in and far for some students.
- More efficient if can pre-booking and can manage more time.
- Pre-online consultation and safe time
- Can give more health information to students and increase health awareness.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- To promote student health and wellness through easy access to medical resources, health tracking tools, and health tips and advice.

(Exampleï¼šBy the end of the first year of implementation, the proposed system will reduce PKU processing time by 25%, resulting in a 25% reduction in administrative workload.)

- To provide a platform for students to communicate with medical professionals at the PKU facility, receive medical advice, and make appointments for medical services.

- To provide a quick and easy way for students to call for emergency assistance in case of a medical emergency.

- To collect and analyze data on student health trends, allowing PKU to better understand the health needs of the student population and provide targeted interventions.


### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
