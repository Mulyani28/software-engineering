                    <h2>Facebook owner Meta’s profits exceed expectations</h2>
                    <p>Meta, Facebook and Instagram's parent firm, has reported a profit of $5.7bn (£4.6bn) for the
                        first quarter of this year, surpassing expectations for a period in which many jobs were
                        cut.

                        It said artificial intelligence (AI) was "driving good results" across its business.

                        Total revenue was $28.6bn, while the number of people on Facebook every month rose to just
                        under three billion.

                        "Our community continues to grow," said chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

                        "We're also becoming more efficient so we can build better products faster, and put
                        ourselves in a stronger position to deliver our long-term vision," he said.</p>

                    <h2>AI creators must study consciousness, experts warn</h2>
                    <p>The term AI covers computer systems able to do tasks that would normally need human
                        intelligence. This includes chatbots able to understand questions and respond with
                        human-like answers, and systems capable of recognising objects in pictures.

                        Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), an AI system developed by ChatGPT chatbot
                        creator OpenAI, can now successfully complete the bar exam, the professional qualification
                        for lawyers, although it still makes mistakes and can share misinformation.

                        But this is just one function of AI. AI products are being deployed in many sectors,
                        including health research, marketing and finance.</p>

                    <h2>UK games sector wanted Microsoft deal, says Ian Livingstone</h2>
                    <p>The UK games sector was in favour of Microsoft's bid for US firm Activision being approved,
                        according to the man who led the company behind Tomb Raider.

                        Ian Livingstone, who also co-founded Games Workshop, said it would be "odd" if the UK was
                        the only place to object.

                        The blocking of the deal by the UK regulator provoked a furious response from Microsoft,
                        with its president saying the move was "bad for Britain".

                        The UK's move means the multi-billion dollar deal cannot go ahead globally.

                        The planned $68.7bn (£55bn) deal would have been the gaming industry's biggest ever
                        takeover, and Microsoft would have taken ownership of popular games titles such as Call of
                        Duty, Candy Crush and World of Warcraft.</p>
