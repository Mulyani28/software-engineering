# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management System
## Key steps in developing the system

1.<b>Identifying the requirements</b>: The first step in developing a student health and wellness management system is to identify the requirements of the system. This involves understanding the needs of the university, the students, and the health and wellness professionals who will be using the system.

2.<b>Defining the scope</b>: Once the requirements have been identified, the scope of the project needs to be defined. This involves determining the features and functionalities that the system will have, as well as any constraints that may affect the development process.

3.<b>Designing the system architecture</b>: The next step is to design the system architecture. This involves determining the components of the system, their interactions, and how they will work together to achieve the desired functionalities.

4.<b>Developing the system</b>: After the system architecture has been designed, the next step is to start developing the system. This involves writing the code, creating the database, and integrating the different components of the system.

5.<b>Testing the system</b>: Once the system has been developed, it needs to be tested to ensure that it works as expected. This involves conducting various tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

6.<b>Deploying the system</b>: After the system has been tested and any issues have been resolved, the system can be deployed. This involves installing the system on the university's servers and making it available to the users.

7.<b>Providing training and support</b>: Once the system has been deployed, the final step is to provide training and support to the users. This involves providing documentation, training sessions, and ongoing technical support to ensure that the system is used effectively and efficiently.
