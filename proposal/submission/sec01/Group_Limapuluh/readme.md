### 1. Executive Summary
- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Background:
-The student feedback management system is an important component of any higher education institution's efforts to continually improve the quality of education and the overall student experience. Currently, our institution lacks an effective system for collecting, analyzing, and acting on student feedback. The existing feedback system is ad hoc and lacks consistency, making it difficult to track trends and identify areas for improvement. This results in missed opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning outcomes and improving the overall student experience.

-Our proposed student feedback management system aims to address these challenges by introducing a comprehensive, automated system that collects and analyzes feedback from students on a regular basis. The proposed system leverages modern technology and best practices in data analytics to deliver a user-friendly interface that enables students to provide feedback easily and effectively. The system will be accessible through multiple channels, including web and mobile, and will provide real-time feedback analysis and reporting to faculty and administrators.

-Key features of the proposed system include automated feedback collection, personalized dashboards for faculty and students, trend analysis and data visualization, and data-driven decision making. The system will enable faculty to receive timely and actionable feedback on their teaching, allowing them to make adjustments to their instructional strategies and improve student outcomes. Administrators will have access to real-time data analysis and visualization tools, enabling them to identify areas for improvement and implement evidence-based changes.

-The proposed student feedback management system has the potential to significantly improve the quality of education and the overall student experience at our institution. By providing a comprehensive, automated system for collecting and analyzing feedback, the proposed system will enable us to identify areas for improvement and take action in a timely and effective manner. Additionally, the system will provide valuable insights and analytics that can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve student outcomes. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to position our institution as a leader in educational technology innovation and improve our competitive edge in attracting and retaining students.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

Objective 1: Improve the quality of education
One of the primary objectives of implementing a student feedback system in University Technology Malaysia (UTM) is to improve the quality of education. The feedback provided by students can help the faculty and administration identify areas where improvements can be made. This, in turn, can lead to better teaching methods, course materials, and assessments.

Objective 2: Enhance student engagement
A student feedback system can also help to enhance student engagement in the learning process. When students feel that their feedback is being heard and taken seriously, they are more likely to feel invested in their education. This can lead to increased motivation and better academic outcomes.

Objective 3: Provide a platform for continuous improvement
A student feedback system can also serve as a platform for continuous improvement. By collecting feedback regularly, UTM can identify trends and make adjustments as needed. This can help to ensure that the university is meeting the needs of its students and providing the best possible educational experience.

Objective 4: Foster transparency and communication
Implementing a student feedback system can also foster transparency and communication between students, faculty, and administration. When students have a platform to voice their concerns and suggestions, it can help to build trust and improve the overall culture of the university.

Objective 5: Support accreditation and compliance efforts
Finally, implementing a student feedback system can support UTM's efforts to maintain accreditation and compliance with relevant regulations. Many accrediting bodies require universities to collect and use student feedback to inform decision-making and improve educational outcomes. A robust student feedback system can help UTM meet these requirements and maintain its status as a top-tier institution.
