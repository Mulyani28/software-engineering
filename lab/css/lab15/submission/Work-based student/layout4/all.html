                    <h2>Coachella 2023: BLACKPINK shows it's all about high energy, sisterly love on main stage</h3>
                        <p>On Saturdays, we wear pink, especially when South Korean girl group BLACKPINK is performing
                            its
                            headlining
                            set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

                            The quartet, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa, followed up its Weekend 1
                            performance with
                            another equally impressive and well-oiled set Saturday on the Coachella Stage. The four
                            women
                            stuck to the
                            same set — which might have been a bit of a disappointment for those who were hoping for a
                            surprise
                            appearance from Selena Gomez or Cardi B — but they still kept the energy just as high for
                            the
                            new slate of
                            festivalgoers.</p>

                        <p>Dating back to between 325 and 350 AD, the Speyer wine bottle is thought to be the world's
                            oldest
                            bottle of
                            wine. Now held in the Wine Museum in the German city of Speyer, where it was rediscovered in
                            1867, an
                            analysis of its contents revealed that it holds an ethanol-based liquid. But the glass
                            bottle
                            remains
                            unopened and the vintage unknown. Any prospective wine tasters should be wary – preserved
                            historic beverages
                            can be pungent, to say the least.</p>

                    <h2>Ukraine war: Bakhmut defenders worry about losing support</h3>
                        <p>A year ago Volodymyr and his men were firing all 40 barrels of their BM-21 Grad rocket
                            launcher
                            in one go.
                            Now they can only afford to fire a few at a time at Russian targets.
                            "We haven't got enough ammunition for our weapon," he explains.
                            His unit, the 17th Tank Battalion, is still being called on to provide fire support to
                            Ukrainian
                            forces
                            desperately clinging on to the edges of Bakhmut, the eastern Ukrainian city which Russia has
                            spent months
                            trying to capture.
                            Russian forces are getting ever closer to their goal of taking the city, but at enormous
                            cost.
                            While we're waiting in a line of trees, hidden from view, Volodymyr receives a call to fire
                            his
                            rocket
                            launcher at a Russian mortar position about 15 kilometres away.</p>
