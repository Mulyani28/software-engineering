Successful implementation requires collaboration among the stakeholders and mini mart mnagement. This project offers a promising opportunity for the mini mart to thrive in the digital age, and it should be pursued to fully realize its potential and succeed in the ever-evolving retail landscape.

### 2. Background:
- The UTM online grading system is a software project aimed at improving the grading process for students and faculty members at the University of Technology, Malaysia. The proposal seeks to address the challenges posed by the traditional paper-based grading system, such as delays and inaccuracies in grading, and difficulties in tracking student progress. 
- The project aims to develop a digital platform that will streamline the grading process and provide benefits such as faster grading, greater transparency and accountability, and improved communication. By adopting a digital platform for grading and record-keeping, the university will become more efficient and better equipped to provide a high-quality education to its students in a rapidly evolving global economy.

### 3. Objectives:
- To develop a digital platform for real-time grading that improves accuracy, transparency, and accountability, reducing errors and delays associated with traditional paper-based grading systems.
- To provide a centralized system for recording and tracking student progress, enabling faculty members to monitor academic performance and provide timely feedback to students.
- To enable students to access their grades, schedules, and academic progress reports in real-time, improving their understanding of their progress and enhancing their learning experience.
- To reduce administrative overheads associated with grading and record-keeping, allowing faculty members to focus on teaching and research activities, improving institutional efficiency and productivity.
- To enhance the overall student experience by providing a modern, user-friendly interface for grading and record-keeping, improving engagement and satisfaction with the university's academic processes.

### 4. Scope: 
- Product Catalogue - A comprehensive list of all products available in the mini mart, with information such as name, description, price, and availability.

- Online Ordering - The ability for customers to place orders for products online, including the selection of items, quantities, and payment options.

- Inventory Management - The ability to manage inventory levels, track stock levels, and replenish products as necessary.

- Customer Management - The ability to manage customer data, including customer orders, preferences, and contact information.

- Reporting - The ability to generate reports on sales, inventory, and other relevant data to help with decision making.

- Payment Processing - The ability to process payments securely and efficiently through various payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, or online payment systems.

- Shipping and Delivery - The ability to manage shipping and delivery of products, including tracking and notification of delivery status.

- Security - The system must be secure to ensure customer data is protected and secure from unauthorized access.

Limitations or constraints that may affect the project could include factors such as budget, time constraints, technical limitations, and resource availability. It is important to consider these limitations and constraints when defining the scope of the project to ensure that the project remains feasible and achievable.







### 5. Software Process Model:
The goal of a software process model is to provide a framework for software development that ensures the project is completed within the allocated budget, schedule, and quality standards. The software process model defines the set of activities that must be performed during the software development lifecycle.

For the KTDI DEWI KAYANGAN ENTERPRISE ONLINE SYSTEM, the ideal software process model is the Agile software development process. The justification for this choice is that the Agile methodology emphasizes the iterative and incremental development of software, which is particularly well-suited for complex projects with evolving requirements. In addition, Agile methodology allows for rapid prototyping and customer feedback, which is essential in developing a mini mart online system.

The Agile software development process involves the following phases:

- Planning: The team defines the project scope, objectives, and requirements. Deliverables in this phase include project charters, requirements documents, and a product backlog.
- Design: The team creates the initial design of the system, including wireframes, user interface designs, and architecture diagrams. Deliverables in this phase include design documents, user stories, and user acceptance criteria.
Implementation: The team develops the system incrementally, delivering working software in short sprints. Deliverables in this phase include working software, user acceptance testing reports, and source code.
- Testing: The team performs functional and acceptance testing on the developed software to ensure that it meets the requirements and user acceptance criteria. Deliverables in this phase include test plans, test cases, and defect reports.
Deployment: The team deploys the software to a production environment, ensuring that it is stable and secure. Deliverables in this phase include deployment plans, user guides, and release notes.
- Maintenance: The team provides ongoing support and maintenance of the software, addressing defects and adding new features as needed. Deliverables in this phase include maintenance logs, bug reports, and feature requests.
<br></br>Testing methodologies that would be relevant to the Agile process model include automated testing, exploratory testing, and user acceptance testing. Project management practices that would be relevant include continuous integration, daily stand-up meetings, and sprint planning. Quality assurance processes would involve code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.



A Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool can be used to help plan and track progress throughout the development process. This will help to ensure that the project stays on schedule and that all tasks are completed as planned.

- Access Controls: Access controls should be implemented to restrict access to student data only to authorized personnel. This includes implementing role-based access controls (RBAC), where users are granted access to only the data that they need to perform their job functions. Strong password policies should also be implemented to prevent unauthorized access.

- Secure Communication: All communication between the client and server should be conducted over secure channels, such as HTTPS, to prevent data interception and tampering.

- Regular Data Backups: Regular backups should be taken of the student data and stored in secure locations to ensure that data is not lost in case of a system failure or data corruption.

- System Monitoring: The system should be monitored regularly to detect any security breaches or unusual activity. This includes implementing intrusion detection systems, logging and auditing, and other monitoring tools to detect and respond to security threats.

- Regular Software Updates: Regular software updates should be performed to address any security vulnerabilities or bugs that may be present in the system.

- Employee Training: All employees who have access to student data should be trained on data security best practices, including password hygiene, secure communication, and access control.

By implementing these data security measures, the online grading system can ensure that student data is protected from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse.
