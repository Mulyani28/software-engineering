### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Accommodation System proposal for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) is aimed at addressing the challenges that students and staff face when managing student accommodation. The current process for applying for and managing accommodation is manual and time-consuming, which can result in delays, errors, and frustration for students and staff alike.

To address these challenges, the proposed software system will provide an online platform that allows students to apply for accommodation, make payments, and track the status of their application. KTDI staff will be able to manage room availability and allocation, communicate with students, and access relevant data and reports through a centralized dashboard.

The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and prompts throughout the process. It will also incorporate automated communication channels, such as email notifications, to keep students and staff updated on the status of their applications and requests.

The expected outcomes of the project include improved student satisfaction, as the software system will provide a more convenient and streamlined process for managing accommodation. KTDI staff will also benefit from increased efficiency, as the system will reduce the need for manual data entry and administrative tasks. Finally, the system is expected to reduce errors and delays in the accommodation management process, resulting in a more reliable and efficient system overall.

### 2. Background:
The student accommodation system is an essential aspect of managing student life on a university campus. It automates the process of assigning student room and ensures that students are placed in suitable accommodations that meet their needs and preferences. The system is vital in providing a comfortable and safe living environment for students, promoting their academic success and overall well-being. However, the current manual and unorganised system in KTDI can be time-consuming, prone to error and inconsistencies, leading to inefficiencies in the room allocation and maintainence process and a poor user experience for both students and administrators.
 
Our proposed student accommodation system is focused to overcome these challenges via devloping a modern, spontaneous automated system that streamline the room rentaling and managing process.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
- The risk assessment section identifies and assesses any potential risks that could impact the project, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or changes in project requirements. 
- It should also describe the plans and strategies to mitigate those risks.

### 9. Resources:
- Provide a detailed breakdown of the resources required for the proposed project, including staff, equipment, software, and other expenses.

### 10. Technical Specifications:
- Discuss the technical specifications of the proposed project, including data sources, data schema, data transformations, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other technical details.
- Mention the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that will be used in the project.
- Provide details about the hardware and software requirements for the proposed system.
- Explain the data security measures that will be implemented.

### 11. Timeline and Deliverables: 
- Provide a detailed timeline for the project, including milestones and deadlines.
- Specify the deliverables that will be provided at each milestone. It should also specify the expected time frame for each deliverable and the resources that will be required to complete the project.
- Explain the quality assurance and testing procedures that will be followed.

### 12. Conclusion:
- Conclude your proposal with a call to action, highlighting the benefits of your proposed solution and urging the decision-makers to take action.
- Summarize the proposal and reiterate the importance of the project.
- Mention any potential limitations or challenges that may arise during the project.
- Provide a call to action for the client to approve the proposal and proceed with the project.
