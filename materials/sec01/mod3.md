# AGILE METHODS
## Introduction
Agile methodology is a project management approach that was introduced in 2001 as an alternative to traditional, rigid project management approaches like the waterfall model. Unlike the waterfall model, which follows a sequential, linear approach to software development, agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.

The main difference between agile and the waterfall model is that the waterfall model follows a sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next can begin. This approach can lead to delays and difficulty adapting to changes in customer needs or market conditions. In contrast, agile methodology focuses on delivering a working product in short development cycles, with frequent releases and continuous improvement. This approach allows for greater flexibility and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements.

Agile methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto, which outlines the values and principles of the approach. The manifesto emphasizes the importance of individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile methodology encourages cross-functional teams to work together and collaborate with stakeholders to deliver a high-quality product that meets customer needs.

Overall, agile methodology offers a more flexible and adaptable approach to project management and software development than traditional waterfall models. By emphasizing collaboration, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement, agile methodology can help teams deliver better products in less time while also fostering a more collaborative and engaged work environment.

## Rapid Software Development
Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes rapid development and delivery, planning, and agile development techniques. In software development, these principles are often implemented using tools like GitHub, which is a popular code hosting and collaboration platform that allows teams to work together on software development projects.

1. **Rapid development and delivery:** Agile methodology focuses on delivering a working product in short development cycles, with frequent releases and continuous improvement. With GitHub, teams can work together to rapidly develop and deliver software by collaborating on code, reviewing and merging pull requests, and automating tests and deployment.

2. **Plan development:** Agile methodology encourages teams to plan development based on user stories, which are short descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end-user. In GitHub, teams can create and manage user stories using issues and project boards, which help to organize and prioritize work and track progress towards milestones.

3. **Agile development:** Agile development techniques, such as Scrum and Kanban, are often used to implement agile methodology in software development. With GitHub, teams can use these techniques to manage and complete complex projects by organizing work into sprints, creating backlogs and prioritizing tasks, and visualizing work in progress using project boards and dashboards.

## Agile Development
Agile development is a methodology that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, collaboration, and flexibility. Some key characteristics of agile development that aligns include:

1. **Interleaved development:** Agile development often involves interleaved development, where multiple features or components of a project are developed and tested concurrently. This approach helps to reduce overall development time and can allow for more efficient use of resources.

2. **Series of versions:** Agile development typically involves the creation of a series of versions, with each version representing a subset of the overall project requirements. These versions are often released on a regular basis, with each release incorporating feedback and improvements from previous versions.

3. **Frequent delivery:** Agile development places a strong emphasis on frequent delivery of working software. This helps to ensure that the project stays on track and meets customer needs, while also allowing for feedback and improvements throughout the development process.

4. **Extensive toolset:** Agile development often involves the use of an extensive toolset to help manage the development process. This can include project management software, collaboration platforms, automated testing and deployment tools, and more.

5. **Minimal documentation:** Agile development places a greater emphasis on working software than on comprehensive documentation. While some documentation may be necessary, the focus is on delivering working software and incorporating feedback and improvements as quickly as possible.

All in all, the agile development methodology emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software. By using interleaved development, creating a series of versions, delivering software frequently, using an extensive toolset, and minimizing documentation, agile development can help teams to be more productive, efficient, and responsive to changing requirements and customer needs.

# AGILE DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES
## Agile Development Techniques
Agile development is often implemented through various frameworks or methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). Each methodology has its unique approach to implementing agile principles, but they all share the same values and principles. 
## XP(Extreme Programming)
Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile methodology that focuses on continuous feedback, continuous testing, and continuous delivery. XP was developed in the 1990s as a response to the traditional "waterfall" software development process. The XP methodology is based on a set of practices that are intended to increase software quality and reduce the time it takes to deliver working software. Here are the key practices of XP:

- Pair Programming: Two developers work together on a single computer, continuously reviewing each other's code and providing feedback.

- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Developers write automated tests before writing code to ensure that the code is working as intended.

- Continuous Integration: Developers integrate their code changes frequently, usually several times a day, to detect issues early and ensure that the code is working together.

- Refactoring: Developers improve the code continuously, making it easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

- Simple Design: The focus is on keeping the design simple, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

- Coding Standards: The team agrees on a set of coding standards to ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase.

- Planning Game: A collaborative approach to planning where the development team and the customer work together to prioritize and estimate the work to be done.

The XP methodology places a strong emphasis on teamwork, communication, and feedback, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. By prioritizing customer needs, continuous testing, and continuous delivery, XP helps to ensure that the product is always aligned with customer expectations.
 
 Example of Extreme Approuch to Iterative Development
 - New Versions may be built several times per day
 
 - Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks
 
 - All tests must be run for every build

 - Build is only accepted when the tests sucessfully run

## The Extreme Programming Release Cycle

#### <b>Step 1 User Story Selection<b>
1. Identify the Stakeholders
The first step in choosing user stories is to identify the stakeholders who will be impacted by the software. Stakeholders can include end-users, customers, managers, and other stakeholders who have an interest in the software.

2. Brainstorm User Stories
Once the stakeholders have been identified, the development team should brainstorm user stories that capture the stakeholders' requirements. User stories should be written in a simple, non-technical language and should describe the desired outcome or value to the user.

3. Prioritize User Stories
Once the user stories have been identified, the team should prioritize them based on the customer's needs and the value they provide. Prioritization can be done collaboratively with the customer and the development team.

4. Estimate User Stories
After prioritization, the team should estimate the effort required to complete each user story. This can be done using story points or another relative estimation technique. Estimation should be done collaboratively with the development team and should take into account the team's capacity and expertise.

 #### <b>Step 2 Break Down Stories to Tasks</b>
1. Break Down User Stories
User stories should be broken down into smaller, manageable tasks that can be completed in a single iteration. Breaking down user stories helps to identify any dependencies or technical challenges and ensures that the work is manageable for the team.

2. Validate user stories
Once the user stories have been prioritized, estimated, and broken down, the team should validate them with the customer. This ensures that the user stories capture the customer's requirements and that the priorities and estimates are aligned with the customer's needs.

 #### <b>Step 3 Plan Release</b>
 After all the steps above are completed, the team need to create a release plan based on the priority and dependencies of the stories.

 #### <b>Step 4 Development</b>
 In the development step of the Extreme Programming (XP) release cycle, the actual coding of the software takes place. This step is crucial as it involves turning the requirements and user stories into functional code. The development process in XP is characterized by several practices that are designed to ensure high-quality code that meets the needs of the customer. Some of these practices include:

I. Pair programming:
 In XP, developers work in pairs on the same code. This practice ensures that the code is reviewed as it is being written, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving the quality of the code.

II. Continuous integration: 
 XP emphasizes frequent integration of code changes into the main codebase. This ensures that code is tested and integrated early, reducing the risk of problems being discovered later in the development process.

III. Test-driven development: 
 XP follows a test-driven development approach, where developers write automated tests for their code before writing the code itself. This ensures that the code meets the requirements and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs into the codebase.

IV. Refactoring:
 XP encourages frequent refactoring of the codebase to keep it clean and maintainable. This ensures that the code remains easy to work with and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs into the codebase.

Overall, the development step in the XP release cycle is focused on producing high-quality code that meets the needs of the customer while ensuring that the code remains easy to work with and maintainable.
