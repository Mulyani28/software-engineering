### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Accommodation System proposal for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) is aimed at addressing the challenges that students and staff face when managing student accommodation. The current process for applying for and managing accommodation is unintegrated and time-consuming, which can result in delays, errors, and frustration for students and staff alike.

To address these challenges, the proposed software system will provide an online platform that allows students to apply for accommodation, make payments, and track the status of their application. KTDI staff will be able to manage room availability and allocation, communicate with students, and access relevant data and reports through a centralized dashboard.

The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and prompts throughout the process. It will also incorporate automated communication channels, such as email notifications, to keep students and staff updated on the status of their applications and requests.

The expected outcomes of the project include improved students and also KTDI staffs satisfaction, as the software system will provide a more convenient and streamlined process for managing accommodation. KTDI staff will also benefit from increased efficiency, as the system will reduce the need for manual data entry and administrative tasks. Finally, the system is expected to reduce errors and delays in the accommodation management process, resulting in a more reliable and efficient system overall. For the maintenance part, we ensure that KTDI rooms will remain well-maintained thanks to the maintenance system, providing students with a cosy and secure living space.

### 2. Background
The student accommodation system is an essential aspect of managing student life on a university campus. It automates the process of assigning student room and ensures that students are placed in suitable accommodations that meet their needs and preferences. The system is vital in providing a comfortable and safe living environment for students, promoting their academic success and overall well-being. However, the current unintegrated and unorganised system in KTDI can be time-consuming, prone to error and inconsistencies, leading to inefficiencies in the room application and management process and a poor user experience for both students and administrators.

Our proposed student accommodation system is focused to overcome these challenges via devloping a modern, spontaneous automated system that streamline the room rentaling and managing process. To provide students, staff, and administrators with a seamless user experience, the proposed system makes advantage of the most recent technology and best practises. The developed system will provide an efficient and effective way for students to apply for hostel online based on their selections and for administrators to allocate housing quickly and accurately.

The key features of this system include a user-friendly interface that integrates with other university systems such as billing and student information, and enhanced data analysis capabilities to provide insights into occupancy rates, student preferences, and college merits. It also embraces features such as tracking maintenance requests, scheduling repairs and replacements, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations to ensure that student accommodations are well-maintained and safe. Thus, this system enables students to take control on their hostel selection and staff and administrators will additionally profit from enhanced room management, data analytics, and more effective working operation.
  
The student accommodation system features offer significant benefits for the university community, with the potential to impact the accommodation allocation process positively. The automation of the allocation process will increase efficiency, save time, and eliminate errors that often occur during manual allocation. The online application process will simplify the application process for students, creating a better user experience. The data analysis capabilities will allow administrators to make informed decisions about future housing allocation, resulting in a more strategic and effective approach. The enhanced security measures will protect students' personal information, improving privacy and security. The maintenance system will ensure the hostel remains well-maintained, creating a comfortable and safe living environment for students. Therefore, the student accommodation system features will improve the quality of the accommodation allocation process, streamline processes, improve the student experience, and enhance the reputation of the university.

### 4. Scope
The scope of the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) refers to the boundaries or limits of the project, defining what elements the system will and won't have. It outlines the features and functionalities of the system, including its goals, objectives and requirements as well as the expected outcomes and benefits. Here are more detailed explanations of the features and functionality of a student accommodation system:

- Student registration: <br>By entering their personal information, academic information, and housing preferences, students can register as users in the system using the student registration tool. Before letting a student register, the system should confirm their identity and determine whether they qualify for accommodations.

- Room allocation: <br>According on the students' choices, availability, and budget, the system can assign rooms to them using the room allocation tool. The system should include elements including the student's academic programme, year of study, and any unique requirements or requests.

- Room management: <br>The room management feature allows students to manage their rooms through the system. This includes room bookings, check-in, check-out, and maintenance requests. The system should provide a calendar view of the room availability and allow students to book their preferred room and check-in and check-out dates. It should also allow students to request maintenance services for their room and track the status of the request.

- Payment management: <br>Students can use the system to pay their lodging costs thanks to the payment management tool. The system should enable students to monitor their payment history and receipts and offer safe payment options like credit card or internet banking. 

- User management: <br>Administrators can manage user accounts for students, staff and other users via the user management tool. To make sure that users only have access to the functions and information they require, the system should offer capabilities like account creation, modification, and deletion as well as role-based access control.

- Security: <br>The security element guarantees the safety of the system and safeguards the private data of the students. For data transmission and storage, the system should employ secure encryption techniques and features like access control and two-factor authentication should be available to guard against unauthorised access.

- Reporting and analytics: <br>Administrators will be allowed to monitor and analyze the occupancy rates, revenue and maintenance issues of the accommodation system. Reports from the system should include occupancy rates based on the study programme or room type, revenue by time period and building or room-specific maintenance issues.

- Support and maintenance: <br>Residents or students should be able to report problems or request assistance for the maintainence of hostel equipment through the system's help desk and there should be a dedicated team working to quickly resolve these problems.

However, there are several limitations and constraints that may affect the project of a student accommodation system for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI):
  
- Timeframe: <br>The project's constrained timeline can have an impact on the system's scope. The quantity of work that can be accomplished may be constrained by the time available, which could lead to the elimination of particular features or functionalities. The timetable may also have an impact on the system's quality because hurried development might result in mistakes, faults, or missing functionality.

- Technical constraints: <br>Technical limitations, such as compatibility with current systems or infrastructure, a lack of available storage or processing power or security issues, may place restrictions on the system's reach. We may need to assess the infrastructure already in place and decide whether the system is compatible with it. Technical limitations might also call for more resources or specialised experts to be resolved.

- Data privacy: <br>Data privacy is a significant restriction that has an impact on the gathering, storing and usage of personal data. The system's features, such as the volume of data that can be gathered or retained, may be constrained by data privacy laws and regulations. To prevent unauthorised access to confidential information, the system must also be developed with security in mind.
  
- User acceptance: <br>User adoption and acceptance are crucial to the system's success. To be widely accepted and used, a system must fulfil user needs and expectations. Limited user acceptability could lead to decreased utilisation and a worse ROI. To make sure the system satisfies user needs, we may need to undertake user testing and feedback.

- Scalability: <br>To support expansion and growth in the future, the system must be scalable. The architecture and design of the system must be able to accommodate growing numbers of students, rooms and data. For the system to last and be able to change with the needs of the user, scalability limits may call for more resources.
  
In conclusion, we can establish the foundation for the project plan, which outlines the specific tasks, resources, timelines and budgets needed to achieve the project goals by stating out our project scopes and we are able to ensure that our student accommodation system in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) can be completed successfully, on time and within our expected capitals as well as fullfill the needs of all stakeholders.

### 5. Software Process Model
<!-- ***Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. *** -->
  
The software process model's goal is to offer a structured and well-organized method for developing software. It aids in making certain that the software is delivered on schedule, within budget, and in accordance with the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
  
The ideal software process model to be implemented in this project is <b>Agile methodology</b>. This is because of the Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous customer feedback. Besides, the Agile methodology is well-suited for developing software applications where requirements can change frequently, and the development team needs to be able to respond to those changes quickly.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/mobile-jon.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Agile-Methodology.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&ssl=1" width="700px" height="350px"></p>

Here is a breakdown of how the Agile methodology can be applied as a software process model for developing the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI):

1. Planning Phase: In this phase, the development team works with the client to identify the project scope, goals, and objectives. They define the project timeline and milestones, identify project risks, and allocate project resources appropriately. They create a sprint plan for the first iteration and identify the user stories and product backlog items that will be worked on in that sprint.

2. Requirements Gathering Phase: In this phase, the business analyst works with the client to identify and prioritize user requirements. They develop user stories and create the product backlog items. They identify acceptance criteria for each user story and break down user stories into smaller tasks, which are then added to the sprint backlog. The development team and the client then meet to review and finalize the sprint backlog.

3. Design Phase: In this phase, the technical lead works with the development team to develop a high-level design of the system. They identify and design the database schema, create detailed design documents, and develop wireframes and prototypes for the user interface. The design is reviewed with the development team and the client, and any necessary changes are made.

4. Development Phase: In this phase, the development team develops and tests the software components according to the sprint backlog. They conduct code reviews to ensure code quality, write unit tests, and perform unit testing. They update code documentation and conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, address any issues or roadblocks, and plan for the next day.

5. Testing Phase: In this phase, the quality assurarance (QA) engineer works with the development team to develop a test plan and test cases. They conduct functional, integration, and acceptance testing, report and track defects using a bug tracking tool, and ensure the software meets the acceptance criteria. The development team and the client meet to review the test results and identify any necessary changes.

6. Deployment Phase: In this phase, the project manager works with the development team to deploy the software to the production environment. They conduct final testing and ensure that the software meets the client's needs and expectations. They train the client on how to use the software and provide ongoing support as needed.
  
7. Review Phase: In the review phase, the development team and the client review the completed software to ensure that it meets the acceptance criteria and user requirements. This phase involves continuous feedback from the client to make sure that the final product is aligned with their expectations.

8. Launch Phase: In the launch phase, the final product is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves final testing and quality assurance to ensure that the software is stable and functional in the production environment.
  
To assure the quality and functionality of the system, many testing methodologies are employed in this project, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and usability testing. Project management techniques leverage technologies like Kanban boards, sprint planning and regular stand-up meetings to track progress and guarantee task completion on time. To maintain code quality and reduce errors, quality assurance procedures like code review, continuous integration and automated testing are used. These procedures are essential for ensuring the effective deployment and operation of the KTDI system for student accommodation.

In order to reduce this risk, KTDI should carry out user research to comprehend their requirements and preferences, build the system with the user experience in mind, and offer simple and approachable user documentation and assistance.

- Legal and regulatory risk: <br>Laws and regulations pertaining to data privacy, security, and compliance may apply to the student housing system. KTDI should make sure the system complies with pertinent laws and regulations, put robust data privacy and security measures in place, and give clear instructions for handling user data in order to reduce this risk.

- Changes in project requirement:
  - Scope creep: As project requirements change over time, the project's scope may expand, which could cause delays or cause the budget to be exceeded.
  - Incomplete or erroneous specifications could lead to a poorly designed system that doesn't satisfy the needs or expectations of the users.
  - Conflicts amongst Stakeholders: Different Stakeholders may have divergent needs, which can lead to conflicts and delays in decision-making.

- Resource Constraints:
  - Technical risk: <br>Technical problems with the system could include hardware breakdowns, software glitches, and system outages. KTDI should make investments in dependable hardware and software, carry out routine maintenance and updates, and have back-up procedures in place to manage system downtime in order to reduce this risk.
  - Financial risk: <br>The Student Accommodation System may be expensive to implement and operate, and it's possible that revenue production won't be enough to cover those costs. To lessen this risk, KTDI should create a reasonable budget and revenue strategy to reduce this risk, and should constantly assess the system's ROI to make sure it is generating enough income to cover its costs.
 
To mitigate these risks, the following strategies will be employed:

- Security risk: <br>Strong security mechanisms like firewalls, encryption, and access restrictions should be put in place by KTDI, together with frequent vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to mitigate security concerns. Additionally, they need to educate employees and students on sound cybersecurity procedures.

- User adoption risk: <br>Users can be trained and supported, surveys and feedback sessions can be held, and incentives or rewards can be given to users who successfully adopt and use the system. These actions can all help to reduce the risks associated with user adoption.

- Legal and regulatory risk: <br>KTDI should make sure the system complies with pertinent data protection and privacy legislation, like the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), in order to reduce legal and regulatory risks. Additionally, they should constantly audit and examine the system to make sure it complies with applicable laws and regulations, as well as review and update data protection and privacy policies to ensure compliance with evolving legislation.

Changes in project requirement:
  - The project requirements should be precisely stated, exhaustive, and well-documented.
  - Create a change management strategy that details how modifications to the project scope will be handled, including how they will be documented, reviewed, and approved.
  - Utilise agile project management techniques like Scrum, which offer adaptability to changing requirements while preserving control over the project's scope.
  - To prevent conflicts, effectively communicate changes to the project's requirements to all parties involved, including the project team, users, and management.

Resource Constraints:
  - Technical risk: <br>KTDI should put in place routine data backups and disaster recovery plans, as well as routine maintenance and software and hardware updates, to reduce the technical risks. They should also employ qualified IT specialists to run and maintain the system.
  - Financial risk: <br>To reduce financial risks, KTDI should create a thorough financial strategy that takes into consideration the initial expenditures as well as recurring expenses of the Student Accommodation System. Additionally, they want to look at other sources of income, including adding booking fees or providing premium services. It's crucial to regularly examine and modify financial predictions to take any changes in enrollment or other monetary issues into consideration.

In general, it's crucial to recognise and reduce these risks if we want the KTDI student housing system to be successful. KTDI can lessen possible adverse effects and increase the advantages of the system by taking a proactive approach to risk management.
