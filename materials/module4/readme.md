## Introduction
This repository contains documentation for the software project that we are working on. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a clear and concise understanding of the requirements and design of the software.

The following sections detail the functional requirements, software requirements, and form design of the software. Additionally, the requirement engineering process is outlined, along with the results of interviews conducted with potential users of the software.

We hope that this documentation will serve as a valuable resource throughout the development process, and provide a strong foundation for the successful implementation of the software.
