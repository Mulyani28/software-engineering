# Software Requirements Document (SRD): University Course Management System
<h3>Key steps to develop a University course management system:</h3>

<b>1. Requirements gathering</b>
<br>
Collect all the requirements of the system from stakeholders such as faculty members, students, administrative staff, and other relevant parties.

<b>2. System analysis and design</b>
<br>
Create a detailed system analysis and design document that outlines the overall architecture, functional requirements, database design, user interface design, and other key aspects of the system.

<b>3. Development</b>
<br>
Develop the system using a suitable technology stack and programming language. Make sure to follow good coding practices and use appropriate design patterns.

<b>4. Testing</b>
<br>
Test the system thoroughly to ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

<b>5. Deployment</b>
<br>
Deploy the system in a suitable production environment, such as a cloud server or on-premise server. Make sure the system is properly configured and tested in the deployment environment.

<b>6. Maintenance and support</b>
<br>
Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the system, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and technical support.

<b>7. Continuous improvement</b>
<br>
Continuously monitor and improve the system to meet changing requirements and user feedback. This includes regular updates and upgrades to the system to ensure it remains up-to-date and efficient.
