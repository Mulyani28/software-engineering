# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Event Calendar for UTM

Define the purpose and scope: Decide on the purpose of the calendar and who the target audience is. Will it be for current students, faculty, staff, alumni, or the general public? Will it cover all events on campus or focus on specific types of events?

## 1)Choose a platform: 
Decide on the platform you will use to host and manage the calendar. This could be a pre-existing calendar tool or a custom solution.

## 2)Gather event information: 
Collect all necessary information about each event, including the name, date, time, location, description, and any other pertinent details.

## 3)Design the calendar:
Design the calendar with the end-user in mind. Consider the layout and user experience to make it easy to navigate and find events.

## 4)Populate the calendar: 
Add all the events to the calendar, making sure to include all relevant information.

## 5)Promote the calendar:
Promote the calendar to the target audience through various channels such as social media, email newsletters, flyers, and posters.

## 6)Maintain and update the calendar: 
Regularly update and maintain the calendar to keep it current and accurate. Assign someone to manage the calendar and review event submissions regularly to ensure it stays up to date.

# Requirements Engineering

##Gather information: 
The first step is to gather information about the users and their needs. For UTM, the main users would be students, faculty, and staff. Some important questions to consider during this phase are:
- What kind of events do users want to see on the calendar?
- What information do they need to know about the events (date, time, location, description, etc.)?
- How frequently do events occur and how far in advance do users need to know about them?
- How will users access the calendar (website, mobile app, etc.)?

##Define functional requirements: 
Based on the information gathered, the next step is to define the functional requirements of the event calendar. These are the specific features and functions the calendar must perform to meet the needs of users. Some potential functional requirements for UTM's event calendar might include:
- Ability to search and filter events by category, date, and location
- Ability to add events to a personal calendar or set reminders
- Integration with other UTM systems (such as the course registration system or campus map)
- Ability for event organizers to submit events for approval and add details to their listings
- Ability for users to provide feedback on events or suggest new events

##Define non-functional requirements:
In addition to functional requirements, non-functional requirements define the qualities and characteristics the event calendar must possess. Some non-functional requirements for UTM's event calendar might include:
- Usability: The calendar should be easy to navigate and use, with clear labels and intuitive design.
- Performance: The calendar should load quickly and be able to handle a large volume of events and users without crashing or slowing down.
- Security: The calendar should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse.
- Accessibility: The calendar should be accessible to users with disabilities, complying with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0.
- Prioritize requirements: Once all the requirements are defined, it's important to prioritize them based on their importance and feasibility. This can be done by ranking each requirement on a scale of 1-5 for importance and difficulty. This helps ensure that the most critical and achievable requirements are implemented first.

##Validate requirements:
Finally, the requirements should be validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately capture the needs of users and can be met within the project timeline and budget. Feedback from stakeholders can be incorporated into the requirements documentation before development begins.
