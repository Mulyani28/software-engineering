## Stakeholders
Stakeholders in an academic course registration system can be broadly categorized into three groups:

### 1. Students
Students are the primary users of the course registration system. They need to be able to search for courses, register for classes, drop or swap classes, and view their schedules. They also need to be able to view their grades and academic records.

### 2. Faculty Members
Faculty members are responsible for managing their courses and grading students. They need to be able to view their course rosters, submit grades, and communicate with students. They may also need to view student records to identify any academic issues.

### 3. University Administrators
University administrators are responsible for managing the overall academic operations of the university. They need to be able to monitor course availability, manage course scheduling and capacity, and view student enrollment data. They may also need to view student records for reporting and compliance purposes.

Other stakeholders may include academic advisors, department chairs, and IT staff who are responsible for maintaining and updating the course registration system.

Understanding the needs and requirements of these stakeholders is crucial for designing a course registration system that is user-friendly, efficient, and meets the academic needs of the university. It is important to involve stakeholders in the requirements gathering and validation process to ensure that the system meets their expectations and addresses their pain points.

## Users and system requirements
Users and system requirements are two different aspects of an academic course registration system, and it is important to understand the differences between them.

### User requirements
Users refer to the people who will be using the system, including students, faculty members, and university administrators. They have specific needs, preferences, and expectations from the system, and their requirements are often expressed in terms of user stories, scenarios, or use cases. For example, a student may require the ability to search for courses by department, instructor, or time of day, while a faculty member may require the ability to view student transcripts or communicate with their class via email.

### System requirements
System requirements, on the other hand, refer to the technical and functional specifications of the system. They describe what the system must do, and are often expressed in terms of features, capabilities, and constraints. For example, the system may need to be able to handle a certain number of concurrent users, have robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and integrate with other university systems such as the student information system or the learning management system.

While user requirements and system requirements are distinct, they are closely related, and it is important to ensure that they are aligned. The system requirements should be designed to meet the needs and expectations of the system's users, and the user requirements should be prioritized and translated into specific system requirements. By understanding both users and system requirements, designers and developers can create a course registration system that meets the needs of its stakeholders while being technically sound and reliable.
