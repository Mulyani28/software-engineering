### 1. Executive Summary
Our proposed UTM Event Management System is a comprehensive solution aimed at simplifying and streamlining the processes of event management for organisers, attendees, and administrators. To achieve this, we're using cutting-edge technology and industry best practises to create a seamless user experience that makes it simple for event planners to plan and carry out successful events and for attendees to find, register for, and participate in events. The key features of our system include real-time event scheduling, registration, various types of activities and merit, and feedback capabilities. These features enable event planners and administrators to optimise event preparation, track performance, and make data-driven decisions. A user-friendly interface and  integration with various social media sites would also be helpful to attendees. Ultimately, our UTM Event Management System will provide measurable value to all stakeholders, resulting in increased event participation, better engagement and satisfaction, and a stronger institutional reputation. By investing in our system, UTM will be at the forefront of event management technology and innovation.

### 2. Background:
Events are an essential part of the University of Technology, Malaysia (UTM) experience. However, the current manual process of managing events is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks the ability to provide real-time information about event performance. These difficulties have had a detrimental effect on participants' overall experiences, leading to poor event organisation and low participation rates.

The proposed UTM Event Management System aims to address these challenges by introducing an innovative, intuitive, and automated system that streamlines the event management process. The proposed system leverages the latest technologies and industry best practices to deliver a seamless user experience for organisers, attendees, and administrators. Real-time event scheduling, registration, different sorts of activities and credits, and feedback capabilities are among the system's key features, which give organisers and administrators the ability to optimise event planning, monitor performance, and make informed data-driven decisions.

All stakeholders, including organisers, attendees, and administrators, stand to benefit considerably from the proposed UTM Event Management System. The suggested method will save time, cut down on errors, and boost satisfaction by lessening the administrative burden of manual processes. The system will also offer insightful analytics that can be utilised to inform decisions that will enhance the outcomes of events. Overall, the suggested approach has the potential to establish UTM as a pioneer in event management innovation and technology and strengthen its competitive edge in luring and retaining attendees.

In summary, the UTM Event Management System proposal seeks to address the challenges associated with the current manual event management process by introducing a modern, automated, and user-friendly solution that provides measurable benefits and enhances the overall experience of all stakeholders. The proposed system has the potential to transform event management at UTM, improve event outcomes, and enhance UTM's reputation as a leading institution of higher learning.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
The development of the academic course registration system for 30,000 users within a year will involve various costs, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. The budget for this project is estimated at **RM 900,000**, as outlined below:

- **Hardware Costs: RM 400,000** <br>
This includes the cost of servers, storage, networking equipment, and other hardware required to support the system. This cost will vary depending on the specific hardware configuration chosen, but it is essential to ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users and data volume.

- **Software Costs: RM 150,000** <br>
This includes the cost of licences for any third-party software required, such as operating systems, databases, and development tools. It also includes the cost of any software development needed for the project, such as custom modules or integrations.

- **Personnel Costs: RM 54,000** <br>
This includes the cost of the development team, project managers, and quality assurance specialists. The team size and composition will vary depending on the complexity of the project, but it is essential to ensure that the team has the necessary skills and experience to complete the project on time and within budget.

- **Testing Costs: RM 95,500** <br>
This includes the cost of testing the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. This cost will depend on the testing approach chosen, such as manual or automated testing.

- **Other Expenses: RM 100,500** <br>
This includes the cost of rent for office space, utilities, marketing and advertising, and testing.

- **Contingency Plan: RM 100,000** <br>
It is always recommended to have a contingency plan for unexpected expenses that may arise during the project. This can include budget reserves or adjusting the scope of the project if necessary.

In conclusion, the estimated budget for the development of the UTM Event Management System is RM 900,000. The budget will cover the costs associated with hardware, software, personnel, testing, and contingency. Any changes in the budget will be communicated to stakeholders and project sponsors.
