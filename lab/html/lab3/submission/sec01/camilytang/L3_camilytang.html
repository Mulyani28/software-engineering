        <b>LANGLEY, VA—</b>A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA
        has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
        highlighters.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the report, sections of the documents— <i>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"</i>—are
            marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting
            policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
        </p>

        <p>
            CIA Director <b>Porter Goss </b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars
            of several historic events, such as: <br>

            * the Cold War<br>
            * the civil-rights movement <br>
            * the growth of the international drug trade
    </ul>
    </p>
