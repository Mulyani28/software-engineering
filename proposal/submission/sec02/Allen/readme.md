### 1. Executive Summary
- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Background:
- The introduction should provide background information about the software project and the purpose of the proposal. 
- It should also briefly describe the problem the software is meant to solve, the benefits it will provide, and its potential impact on the organization.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- The goal of the software process model is to provide a systematic and structured approach to software development that maximizes efficiency, reduces risk, and improves the overall quality of the UTM online grading system.
- For the UTM online grading system, the ideal software process model would be the iterative and incremental model. The iterative and incremental model is a flexible and adaptable approach that involves a series of iterations, each consisting of planning, designing, developing, testing, and delivering phases. This model is ideal for projects where requirements are likely to change or evolve, as it allows for flexibility and adaptability.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
- The risk assessment section identifies and assesses any potential risks that could impact the project, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or changes in project requirements. 
- It should also describe the plans and strategies to mitigate those risks.

### 9. Resources
The following are the resources required for creating an online grading system for a university especially UTM online grading system:

1. Staff:
- Project Manager: responsible for overseeing the project, managing resources, and ensuring the project is delivered on time and within budget.
- Business Analyst: responsible for gathering and analyzing requirements, creating functional specifications, and identifying system requirements.
- Developers: responsible for building and implementing the system.
- Quality Assurance (QA) Analysts: responsible for testing the system and ensuring that it meets requirements and is bug-free.
- Technical Writers: responsible for creating user manuals and system documentation.
- User Experience (UX) Designers: responsible for creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

2. Equipment:
- Server infrastructure: a robust server infrastructure is required to host the grading system and ensure it can handle large volumes of traffic.
- Network infrastructure: high-speed internet connectivity and network equipment to connect the system to the internet and the university network.
- Workstations: computers for the development and QA teams.

3. Software:
- Programming languages: the system can be built using different programming languages and frameworks, depending on the preferences and expertise of the development team.
- Database software: a database management system to store and manage student and grading data.
- Web server software: to host the grading system and serve content to users.
- Testing software: automated testing tools to ensure the system is free of bugs and errors.
- Security software: firewalls, antivirus software, and other security measures to ensure the system is protected from cyber threats.

4. Other Expenses:
- Licensing fees: some software components may require licensing fees.
- Training: training for staff members to ensure they are familiar with the system and can use it effectively.
- Maintenance and support: ongoing maintenance and support to ensure the system remains secure, updated, and functional.

### 10. Technical Specifications:
- Discuss the technical specifications of the proposed project, including data sources, data schema, data transformations, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other technical details.

The following are the technical specifications for UTM online grading system:

1. Data Source
- Student data: including personal information, enrollment records, and academic performance data.
- Faculty data: including personal information, course schedules, and grading records.
- Course data: including course schedules, course descriptions, and prerequisites.

2. Data Schema
- The data schema for the grading system would need to include tables for student information, course information, enrollment records, grading records, and other relevant data.

3. Data Transformations
- Data transformations may be necessary to ensure the data is clean, consistent, and in the appropriate format for analysis. For example, data may need to be transformed to ensure it is compatible with the database management system being used.

4. Machine Learning Algorithms
- Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze student data and identify patterns and trends. For example, clustering algorithms could be used to group students based on their academic performance, while regression algorithms could be used to predict future grades.

5. Data Visualization Tools
- Data visualization tools can be used to display grading data in a visually appealing and easily understandable format. For example, graphs and charts could be used to show the distribution of grades for a particular course or to compare the performance of different students.

6. Other Technical Details

- Database Management System: a robust database management system would be required to store and manage student and grading data.
- Web Development Framework: a web development framework would be used to build the front-end of the grading system.
- Server Infrastructure: a robust server infrastructure would be required to host the grading system and ensure it can handle large volumes of traffic.
- Security Measures: robust security measures would need to be in place to protect the system from cyber threats and ensure student data remains secure.
