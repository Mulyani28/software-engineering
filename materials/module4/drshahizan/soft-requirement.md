# Part 3: Requirements Engineering

A requirements specification is a document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system or application. It is a critical document that acts as a blueprint for the development process, as it lays out the scope of the project, its objectives, and the features and functionality required to meet those objectives. 

The requirements specification is typically created during the initial stages of software development, and it serves as a guide for the entire development team, including project managers, developers, testers, and stakeholders. The document includes information such as project scope, goals, and objectives, as well as detailed descriptions of the features and functionality required for the system.

The requirements specification document typically includes the following information:

1. **Introduction**: This section provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, scope, and stakeholders.

2. **Functional Requirements**: This section outlines the specific features and functionality that the system must have to meet its objectives. It includes use cases, user stories, and other detailed descriptions of the software's behavior.

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: This section covers requirements that are not directly related to the software's functionality, such as performance, security, and reliability.

4. **Assumptions and Constraints**: This section includes any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process and any constraints that may affect the development process.

5. **Acceptance Criteria**: This section outlines the criteria that the system must meet to be considered acceptable by stakeholders.

6. **Glossary**: This section defines any technical terms or acronyms used in the document.

Overall, the requirements specification document plays a crucial role in the software development process. It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project's objectives and what is expected from the final product. It also helps to minimize misunderstandings and ensures that the development team can deliver a product that meets the needs of the business and its users.
