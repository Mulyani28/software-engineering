# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Engagement System
## Key steps in creating a Student Engagemen System
### 1. Identify the specific needs and goals of the educational institution and its students:
Conduct research and gather input from various stakeholders, such as students, instructors, and administrators, to determine what specific needs and goals the Student Engagement System should address.

### 2. Define the system requirements based on the identified needs and goals:
Based on the research and input gathered, define the system requirements that the Student Engagement System needs to meet. This includes defining user roles, features, functionality, and any technical requirements and constraints.

### 3. Design the system architecture and user interface:
Select appropriate technologies and frameworks, define data models and database schema, and design the user interface to ensure that it is user-friendly and accessible on all devices.

### 4. Develop and test the system:
Write code to implement the system features, test the system to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free from bugs and errors, and conduct user acceptance testing to gather feedback from users and make any necessary improvements.

### 5. Deploy and maintain the system:
Deploy the system to a production environment and provide ongoing technical support, making updates and improvements to the system as needed to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the educational institution and its users.
## Requirement Engineering Process
The requirement engineering process for creating a Student Engagement System typically involves the following steps:

### 1. Requirements elicitation:
This involves identifying the needs and requirements of the stakeholders, such as students, faculty, and administrators. This can be achieved through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other techniques.

### 2. Requirements analysis:
The requirements gathered from stakeholders are analyzed to identify commonalities, conflicts, and gaps. The analysis helps to identify the core features and functionalities that the Student Engagement System should have.

### 3. Requirements specification:
The identified requirements are documented in a Requirements Specification document that outlines the features, functionality, and constraints of the system. The document serves as a reference point for development and testing.

### 4. Requirements validation:
This step involves reviewing the requirements specification document to ensure that all requirements are clear, complete, and consistent. It may also involve seeking feedback from stakeholders to ensure that the system will meet their needs.

### 5. Requirements management:
As the project progresses, requirements may change due to evolving needs, new stakeholders, or other factors. Therefore, it is important to manage the requirements throughout the project to ensure that they remain relevant and achievable.

Overall, the requirement engineering process helps to ensure that the Student Engagement System meets the needs of its stakeholders and is delivered on time and within budget.
