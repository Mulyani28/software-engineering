  <h1>Key Steps in Creating an Academic Course Registration System</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>System requirements gathering</li>
    <p>The first step is to gather requirements for the system. This involves talking to stakeholders such as students,
      faculty members, and university administrators to understand their needs and expectations from the system. The
      system requirements should include features such as course catalog, course registration, scheduling, waitlist
      management, grade management, and student information management.</p>
    <li>System design</li>
    <p>Once the requirements are gathered, the next step is to design the system. This involves creating a detailed
      system design document that outlines the system architecture, database design, and user interface design.</p>
    <li>System development</li>
    <p>The system development involves implementing the design using programming languages, tools, and frameworks. The
      system should be developed with scalability and maintainability in mind, so that it can handle a large number of
      students and courses.</p>
    <li>System testing</li>
    <p>After the system is developed, it needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and
      works as expected. Testing should be done for all possible scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.</p>
    <li>System deployment</li>
    <p>Once the system is tested and approved, it needs to be deployed on the university's servers or cloud
      infrastructure. The system should be monitored for performance and availability.</p>
    <li>System maintenance</li>
    <p>After the system is deployed, it needs to be maintained and updated to ensure that it continues to meet the
      changing needs of the university. This involves fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance.</p>
  </ol>
  <p>The academic course registration system should provide a user-friendly interface for students to browse and
    register for courses, as well as for faculty members to manage their courses and student grades. The system should
    also allow for automated waitlist management and scheduling conflicts. Overall, the system should streamline the
    course registration process and reduce administrative burden for the university staff.</p>
  <h2>Requirements elicitation</h2>
  <p>The requirements elicitation process involves gathering information about the needs and expectations of the
    stakeholders. For an HMS, stakeholders include hostel administrators, residents, and maintenance staff. To
    understand their requirements for the system, interviews, surveys, and feedback sessions can be conducted.</p>

  <h2>Requirements analysis</h2>
  <p>Once the requirements are elicited, they need to be analyzed to determine their feasibility, relevance, and
    completeness. This may involve prioritizing the requirements based on their importance and identifying any
    conflicting or ambiguous requirements. The requirements analysis phase should consider features such as room
    management, resident management, billing and payments, and maintenance management.</p>

  <h2>Requirements specification</h2>
  <p>After the requirements are analyzed, they need to be documented in a clear and concise manner. This may involve
    creating use cases, user stories, or formal requirement documents that describe the system's functionality and
    constraints. The requirements specification should describe the system's functionality, user interfaces, and
    expected outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Requirements validation</h2>
  <p>Once the requirements are specified, they need to be validated to ensure that they are accurate and complete. This
    may involve reviewing the requirements with stakeholders and conducting user acceptance testing to verify that the
    system meets their needs. The validation process should ensure that the system meets the needs of all stakeholders,
    is user-friendly, and efficient.</p>

  <h2>Requirements management</h2>
  <p>Finally, the requirements need to be managed throughout the development lifecycle to ensure that they remain
    relevant and up-to-date. This may involve tracking changes to the requirements and ensuring that they are properly
    implemented in the system. The requirements management phase should ensure that the system is scalable and can
    accommodate future growth in the number of residents and staff.</p>

  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>Stakeholders in an HMS can be broadly categorized into the following groups:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hostel Administrators</li>
    <li>Residents</li>
    <li>Maintenance Staff</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other stakeholders may include university administrators, IT staff, and security staff who are responsible for
    maintaining and updating the HMS.</p>
  <p>Understanding the needs and requirements of these stakeholders is crucial for designing an HMS that is
    user-friendly, efficient, and meets the operational needs of the hostel. It is important to involve stakeholders in
    the requirements gathering and validation process to ensure that the system meets their expectations and addresses
    their pain points.</p>
  <p>System requirements for a hostel management system refer to the technical and functional specifications that the
    system must meet to operate efficiently and effectively. These requirements are often expressed in terms of
    features, capabilities, and constraints, and they are focused on ensuring that the system meets the needs of its
    users while being technically sound and reliable.</p>
  <h2>Examples of System Requirements</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Room and Bed Management</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The system should be able to manage the allocation of rooms and beds to students, including the ability to
        assign, reassign, and release rooms and beds.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Billing and Payment</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The system should be able to generate bills for students, including accommodation fees, meal charges, and
        other related expenses. It should also provide options for payment, such as online payment or payment at the
        front desk.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Maintenance Management</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The system should be able to manage the maintenance of hostel facilities, including tracking maintenance
        requests, scheduling repairs, and monitoring the status of repairs.</li>
