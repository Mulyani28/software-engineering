# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Grading System

Designing a university student grading system requires careful consideration of various factors. Here are the key steps that need to be taken to create an effective student grading system:

# 1. System Requirement Gathering:
a. Identify stakeholders: Identify key stakeholders, such as students, faculty, and administrators, and understand their needs and expectations.
b. Define requirements: Define the grading policies, grading scales, and weightage of each grade component. Determine the grade calculation formulas, grade rounding rules, and grade release policies.

# 2. System Design:
a. Develop the database: Create a database to store all the relevant data, such as student records, course information, and grading components. Ensure the database supports efficient data retrieval, storage, and processing.

b. Create user interfaces: Design user-friendly interfaces for faculty and administrators to enter grades and for students to view their grades. The interfaces should be designed to support various grading functions, such as grade entry, grade calculation, and grade release.

c. Integrate with other systems: The grading system should be integrated with other systems used by the university, such as the student information system and the learning management system. This will ensure seamless data exchange and reduce the need for duplicate data entry.

d. Develop grading rules and policies: Develop grading rules and policies to ensure consistency and fairness in grading. This includes guidelines for handling grade appeals, grade corrections, and grade confidentiality.

# 3. System Development:
a. Develop the grading system: Using the requirements and design, develop the grading system, including database schema, user interface design, integration with other systems, and grading rules and policies.

b. Test the system: Test the system thoroughly to ensure that it meets the grading system requirements and functions correctly. This includes testing the user interfaces, database, and system integration.

# 4. System Implementation:
a. Launch the system: After testing, the grading system can be launched. Communicate the launch of the system to all stakeholders and provide training to users to ensure that they can use the system effectively.

# 5.System Maintenance:
a. Monitor and maintain the system: The grading system needs to be monitored and maintained to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the users. This includes monitoring system performance, addressing user feedback, and making updates and improvements as needed.

These steps will help you create an effective university student grading system that meets the needs of faculty, administrators, and students, while ensuring consistency and fairness in grading.
