# AGILE METHODS
## Introduction
Agile methodology is a project management approach that was introduced in 2001 as an alternative to traditional, rigid project management approaches like the waterfall model. Unlike the waterfall model, which follows a sequential, linear approach to software development, agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.

The main difference between agile and the waterfall model is that the waterfall model follows a sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next can begin. This approach can lead to delays and difficulty adapting to changes in customer needs or market conditions. In contrast, agile methodology focuses on delivering a working product in short development cycles, with frequent releases and continuous improvement. This approach allows for greater flexibility and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements.

Agile methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto, which outlines the values and principles of the approach. The manifesto emphasizes the importance of individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile methodology encourages cross-functional teams to work together and collaborate with stakeholders to deliver a high-quality product that meets customer needs.

Overall, agile methodology offers a more flexible and adaptable approach to project management and software development than traditional waterfall models. By emphasizing collaboration, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement, agile methodology can help teams deliver better products in less time while also fostering a more collaborative and engaged work environment.

## Rapid Software Development
Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes rapid development and delivery, planning, and agile development techniques. In software development, these principles are often implemented using tools like GitHub, which is a popular code hosting and collaboration platform that allows teams to work together on software development projects.

1. **Rapid development and delivery:** Agile methodology focuses on delivering a working product in short development cycles, with frequent releases and continuous improvement. With GitHub, teams can work together to rapidly develop and deliver software by collaborating on code, reviewing and merging pull requests, and automating tests and deployment.

2. **Plan development:** Agile methodology encourages teams to plan development based on user stories, which are short descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end-user. In GitHub, teams can create and manage user stories using issues and project boards, which help to organize and prioritize work and track progress towards milestones.

3. **Agile development:** Agile development techniques, such as Scrum and Kanban, are often used to implement agile methodology in software development. With GitHub, teams can use these techniques to manage and complete complex projects by organizing work into sprints, creating backlogs and prioritizing tasks, and visualizing work in progress using project boards and dashboards.
