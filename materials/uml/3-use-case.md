# Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams are a type of diagram used in software development to describe the behavior of a system from the point of view of its users or actors. These diagrams are often used to identify the functional requirements of a system, and can help to ensure that all user needs are met.

Draw.io is a web-based diagramming tool that allows users to create a wide variety of diagrams, including use case diagrams. With draw.io, users can easily create and customize use case diagrams using a drag-and-drop interface and a variety of pre-built shapes.

In a use case diagram created using draw.io, the primary actors or users of the system are represented using the "Use Case" shape. Additional actors can be added to the diagram as needed, and can be connected to the use cases using lines.

Each use case is represented by an oval shape, which can be labeled with a brief description of the task or function it performs. The relationships between the use cases and the actors are shown using lines, which can be labeled with a description of the interaction.

Other elements that can be added to a use case diagram using draw.io include text labels, color coding, and icons or images to help organize and clarify the diagram. Once the diagram is complete, it can be exported as an image or saved to a user's computer or cloud storage.

## Create a use case diagram using draw.io

To create a use case diagram using draw.io, you can follow these steps:

1. Open draw.io in your web browser and select "Use Case Diagram" from the list of available templates.

2. Drag and drop the "Use Case" shape onto the canvas to represent the primary actors or users of the system.

3. Next, add the "Actor" shape to represent the actions of the primary actors. 

4. Draw lines from the "Actor" shape to the "Use Case" shape to show the interaction between the actors and the use cases. 

5. Add additional use cases and actors as needed, and connect them with lines to show their relationships.

6. You can also add text labels, color coding, and other elements to help organize and clarify the diagram.

7. Once you have completed the diagram, you can export it as an image or save it to your computer or cloud storage.

Keep in mind that use case diagrams are only one type of diagram used in software development, and should be accompanied by other diagrams such as class diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams to fully describe the system.
