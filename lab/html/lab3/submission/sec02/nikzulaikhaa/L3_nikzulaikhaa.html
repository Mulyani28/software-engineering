		    <b>LANGLEY, VA—A </b> report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has 
        mistakenly obscured<br>hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information  with black highlighters.
        According to the report, sections of the documents— <br>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an 
        indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret <br>highlighting policy that began 
        at the agency's inception in 1947. <br><br>

        CIA Director<b> Porter Goss </b>lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several 
        historic events, such as: 
		    <ul>    
		        <li>the Cold War</li>
		        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
		        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
