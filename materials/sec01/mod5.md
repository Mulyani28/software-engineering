Students will also gain an understanding of how to validate, prioritize, and manage requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the importance of requirements analysis in software development
- Apply techniques for eliciting requirements from stakeholders
- Use tools for modeling requirements, such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams
- Validate and prioritize requirements based on stakeholder needs and constraints
- Manage changes in requirements throughout the software development lifecycle

## Module outline 
## I. Introduction
### Overview of requirements analysis and modeling
Requirements analysis is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle that involves understanding, documenting, and validating the needs of stakeholders for a software system. This phase helps to ensure that the final product meets the expectations of users, business owners, and other stakeholders.

Requirements modeling, on the other hand, involves creating a visual representation of the requirements using various techniques and tools. These models help to communicate the requirements clearly to all stakeholders and provide a basis for designing and developing the software system.

There are different approaches to requirements analysis and modeling, but some common steps include:

**Elicitation:** This involves gathering information from stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints.

**Analysis:** This involves organizing and categorizing the requirements to identify commonalities, conflicts, and ambiguities.

**Specification:** This involves documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner using techniques such as use cases, user stories, or functional requirements.

**Validation:** This involves reviewing and testing the requirements to ensure they are complete, correct, and consistent.

**Modeling:** This involves creating visual representations of the requirements using techniques such as data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, or use case diagrams.

Requirements modeling techniques help to represent the requirements in a way that is easy to understand for stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise. For example, use case diagrams show the interactions between actors and the system, while data flow diagrams show how data moves through the system.

Overall, requirements analysis and modeling are critical for the success of software development projects as they ensure that the software system meets the needs of stakeholders and is delivered on time and within budget.
