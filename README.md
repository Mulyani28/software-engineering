# Software Engineering (WBL)

## Course Synopsis
This course is designed to give students an introduction to an engineering approach in the development of high-quality software systems. It will discuss the important software engineering concepts in the various types of the common software process models. The students will also learn the concepts and techniques used in each software development phase including requirements engineering, software design and software testing. This course will also expose the students to utilizing object-oriented method (e.g., UML) and tools in analyzing and designing the software. At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to appreciate most of the common software engineering concepts and techniques as well as producing various software artifacts and deliverables.

## Course Learning Outcomes
1. Apply the fundamental of software engineering, software process, requirements engineering to solve software engineering case studies.
2. Build suitable software architecture, object-oriented design model and develop test cases in software engineering case studies.
3. Construct software requirements model, software architecture, object-oriented design model and test cases with state-of-the-art methods and tools for a real-world software engineering problem.
4. Ability to establish good rapport, interact with others, work effectively in a team and comprehend the interchangeable role of leaders and followers with team members.
