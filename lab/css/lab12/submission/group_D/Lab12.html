        <p class="indie-flower">UTM has three campuses â€“ the main campus is in Skudai, and was the first university in
            the state of Johor. It has an area of 1148 hectares[9] and is the second largest public university after
            Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). It is about 20 km north of the state capital, Johor Bahru. The branch
            campus is situated in Jalan Semarak within Kuala Lumpur, with an area of 38 hectares.[9] The branch campus
            accommodates diploma students, part-time students (also known as the SPACE program), undergraduate students
            (Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology) and foreign students taking business courses.</p>

    <p>The history of technical education in this country has been a century old. It all began in 1904 when a Technical
        School began its operation on Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to teach Technical Assistants for the Federated
        Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works.</p>

    <p>The school was officially known as Treacher Technical School, named after Sir William Treacher, the Resident
        General during that time. Students followed classed on part-time basis; they worked and trained specifically
        according to the technical needs of their employment.</p>

    <p>Department In 1941, the Advisory Committee of Technical Schools and the Education recommended that the Technical
        School be elevated to a college status and proposed that a new Technical College be constructed. The new college
        was to be built on a 47-acre piece of Government land in Gurney Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans
        for the construction of the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in Peninsular Malaysia.
