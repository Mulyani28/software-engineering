        <p><b>LANGLEY, VA—A </b>report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General
            revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical
            intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

        <p> According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—
            are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret
            highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

        <p> CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars
            of several historic events, such as: <br>

            * the Cold War <br>
            * the civil-rights movement <br>
            * the growth of the international drug trade
    </ul>
    </p><br>
