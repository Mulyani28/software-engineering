### 2. Background:
Events are an essential part of the University of Technology, Malaysia (UTM) experience. However, the current manual process of managing events is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks the ability to provide real-time information about event performance. These challenges have resulted in poor event planning, low participation rates, and a negative impact on the overall experience of attendees.

The proposed UTM Event Management System aims to address these challenges by introducing an innovative, intuitive, and automated system that streamlines the event management process. The proposed system leverages the latest technologies and industry best practices to deliver a seamless user experience for organisers, attendees, and administrators. Key features of the system include  real-time event scheduling, registration, various types of activities and merit, and feedback capabilities, which give organisers and administrators the ability to optimise event planning, monitor performance, and make informed data-driven decisions.

The proposed UTM Event Management System has the potential to significantly improve the overall experience for all stakeholders, including organisers, attendees, and administrators. By reducing the administrative burden of manual processes, the proposed system will save time, reduce errors, and increase satisfaction. Additionally, the system will provide valuable insights and analytics that can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve event outcomes. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to position UTM as a leader in event management technology and innovation and improve its competitive edge in attracting and retaining attendees.

In summary, the UTM Event Management System proposal seeks to address the challenges associated with the current manual event management process by introducing a modern, automated, and user-friendly solution that provides measurable benefits and enhances the overall experience of all stakeholders. The proposed system has the potential to transform event management at UTM, improve event outcomes, and enhance UTM's reputation as a leading institution of higher learning.

### 7. System Architecture:

The proposed system architecture for the event management system will be a web-based system built using modern technologies and frameworks. The system will use the following tools and technologies:

- Programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- Frameworks: Laravel, Bootstrap
- Database: MySQL
- Server: Apache
- Data Visualization: Chart.js
The system will have a multi-tier architecture consisting of a presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. The presentation layer will be responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. The application layer will be responsible for implementing the business logic of the system and handling user requests. The data layer will be responsible for storing and managing data.

To implement the RBAC functionality, we will use Laravel's built-in authorization features to restrict user access based on their roles and permissions. Different interfaces will be provided to each user role based on their needs and permissions.

User input data will be stored in the MySQL database. The system will have tables for events, users, organisers, and other entities. The system will also have tables for storing user input data, such as registration forms, event applications, and venue requests. The data layer will use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to map database tables to PHP classes and provide an abstraction layer for managing data.

Data analysis and visualisation will be implemented using Chart.js, a JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs. We can use Chart.js to visualise data such as event participation rates, event categories, and other metrics.

To improve the load time of the page, we can implement caching techniques such as browser caching, server-side caching, and database caching. We can also optimise images and other assets to reduce page size and improve load time.

The block diagram for the proposed system architecture is as follows:

### 12. Conclusion:

The proposed system aims to improve the usability and effectiveness of the previous system by addressing the issue of low participation rates in co-curricular activities in universities while also enhancing the effectiveness of promoting events to students.

One of the key features of the new system is that it will be accessible to a wide range of users, including students, club and society administrators, lecturers, and administrators in faculties and departments.

Each user will have a specific set of functions and capabilities tailored to their respective roles and responsibilities. For example, students will be able to use the system to browse and sign up for co-curricular activities and customise their calendar for the activity they have joined. Club administrators will be able to create and manage events, submit acknowledgement and application letters, reserve the venue for the physical event, and promote their event on the student page. Faculty and department administrators will have the ability to oversee the system's usage, monitor participation rates, and record events that take place in the university.

Moreover, the new system will offer a high degree of customization and flexibility for each user. This will include the ability to set preferences, adjust settings, and personalise their user interface. The system will also feature notifications, reminders, and feedback mechanisms to ensure that users are engaged and informed about relevant events and activities.
