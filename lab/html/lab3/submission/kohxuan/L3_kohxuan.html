	<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
	mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
	</p>

	<p>
	According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an
	indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at
	the agency's inception in 1947.
	</p>

	<p>
	CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
	historic events, such as:
	<ul><li>the Cold War</li>
	<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
	<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
	</ul>
