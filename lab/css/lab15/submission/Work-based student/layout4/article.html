            <h1>Coachella 2023: BLACKPINK shows it's all about high energy, sisterly love on main stage</h1>
            <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2023/01/attachment-coachella-blackpink.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"
                alt="news">

            <p>On Saturdays, we wear pink, especially when South Korean girl group BLACKPINK is performing its
                headlining
                set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
                <br><br>
                The quartet, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa, followed up its Weekend 1 performance
                with
                another equally impressive and well-oiled set Saturday on the Coachella Stage. The four women stuck to
                the
                same set — which might have been a bit of a disappointment for those who were hoping for a surprise
                appearance from Selena Gomez or Cardi B — but they still kept the energy just as high for the new slate
                of
                festivalgoers.
                <br><br>
                BLACKPINK has been taking the music industry by storm ever since the band's debut in 2016. The four have
                been referred to as the "biggest girl group in the world" and are the highest-charting female Korean act
                on
                the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, landing at No. 13 with their song "Ice Cream," and on the Billboard
                200
                chart, reaching No. 1 with their second album, "Born Pink."
                <br><br>
                Those impressive stats are one possible reason why the four were picked to be a headliner this year, but
                their sheer showmanship is most likely what earned them a place on this year's ticket, becoming the
                first
                K-pop group to achieve the feat. It comes just four years after the four ladies made their Coachella
                debut
                in 2019.
                <br><br>
                BLACKPINK's performance was not only about the music but also about giving the audience spectacular
                visuals.
                After a nearly 10-minute colorful drone show that displayed images of a caterpillar, butterfly, the
                Coachella astronaut and more in the sky, the fierce quartet kicked off their set with echoes of
                “BLACKPINK”
                leading into their first song, “Pink Venom.”
                Right off the bat, audiences could tell they were in for a well-choreographed, well-rehearsed and
                perfectly
                pink set, as LED wristbands specifically made for the concert lit up. Not to mention the girl group wore
                the
                signature color on stage.
                The energy the four women brought to the stage with their dance moves was infectious, as festivalgoers
                swayed and screamed out “BLACKPINK in your area,” their signature phrase, whenever given the
                opportunity.
                And as if the festivities on stage weren’t enough, audience members got to witness pyrotechnics, flames
                and
                fireworks lighting up the night's sky.
                <br><br>
                “It feels absolutely surreal to be here,” Rosé said while addressing the crowd. As each member of the
                group
                introduced herself, they were met with louder and louder cheers.
                <br><br>
                The group’s songs typically blend Korean and English lyrics together, but language posed no barrier for
                fans
                to sing along and enjoy themselves. The first third of their set included hits such as “Kill This Love,”
                “How You Like That,” “Pretty Savage” and “Whistle.”

                    Blackpink's music is the perfect fit for Coachella. They have a great mix of pop, hip-hop, and electronic influences, and I think they're going to bring something totally unique to the festival. It's going to be epic!

                    I'm not usually into K-pop, but Blackpink is different. Their music is so catchy and their performances are so dynamic. I'm definitely going to be at Coachella 2023 to see them live!
