# Part 2: Functional requirement

Functional requirements in an academic course registration system specify the system's intended behavior and the tasks that the system must perform to meet the needs of its users. Functional requirements define the features, capabilities, and tasks that the system must be able to perform to achieve its objectives.

By defining these functional requirements, the academic course registration system can be designed and developed to meet the needs and expectations of its users and achieve its objectives. Functional requirements are essential to ensuring that the system performs its intended tasks accurately, efficiently, and reliably.

## Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements in an academic course registration system describe the system's characteristics and qualities that are not related to its functionality but are still important for its successful operation. Non-functional requirements are concerned with how well the system performs its functions, rather than what functions the system performs.

By defining these non-functional requirements, the academic course registration system can be designed and developed to ensure that it operates effectively, efficiently, and securely. Non-functional requirements are essential to ensuring that the system provides a high-quality user experience, meets performance expectations, and complies with relevant regulations and standards.

### Examples of functional and non-functional requirements

Here are some examples of functional and non-functional requirements in an academic course registration system:

#### Functional Requirements

1. **User registration and login**: The system should allow students, faculty members, and university administrators to create and access their accounts with secure login credentials.

2. **Course search and selection**: The system should allow students to search and select courses from a catalog of available courses based on course code, department, instructor, and other relevant criteria.

3. **Course enrollment and waitlisting**: The system should allow students to enroll in courses that are available and add themselves to a waitlist for courses that are currently full.

4. **Course management**: The system should allow faculty members to manage their courses, including adding and removing students, posting course materials, and communicating with students.

5. **Administrative management**: The system should allow university administrators to manage course enrollment data, generate reports, and perform other administrative tasks related to the academic course registration system.

#### Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and maintain its performance even during peak periods of usage.

2. **Security**: The system should have robust security features to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Usability**: The system should be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear and concise user interfaces that enable users to complete their tasks quickly and easily.

4. **Availability**: The system should be available and accessible to users 24/7 with minimum downtime.

5. **Scalability**: The system should be scalable and able to accommodate future growth and expansion without compromising its performance.

6. **Reliability**: The system should be reliable, with a minimum number of errors, bugs, and failures.

7. **Compliance**: The system should comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards related to data privacy, security, and accessibility.

These functional and non-functional requirements are important for the successful design and development of an academic course registration system that meets the needs and expectations of its users and operates effectively, efficiently, and securely.

## Requirements imprecision

Requirements imprecision in an academic course registration system refers to the presence of ambiguous, incomplete, or poorly defined requirements that can result in misunderstandings or misinterpretations of what the system is supposed to do. Requirements imprecision can arise due to various factors such as inadequate communication between stakeholders, unclear project scope, lack of domain knowledge, or changing requirements.

Examples of requirements imprecision in an academic course registration system may include:

1. **Vague or ambiguous requirements**: A requirement may be worded in such a way that it is open to interpretation, leading to different understandings of what the system should do.

2. **Incomplete requirements**: Requirements that are incomplete, missing key information or details, can lead to assumptions that may result in incorrect or incomplete system design and implementation.

3. **Conflicting requirements**: Conflicting requirements can occur when different stakeholders have different ideas about what the system should do, leading to confusion and delays in system design and implementation.

4. **Unrealistic requirements**: Requirements that are unrealistic, such as those that are beyond the project's scope, budget, or timeline, can lead to overpromising and underdelivering.

Requirements imprecision can lead to significant problems in an academic course registration system, such as the system not meeting user needs, costly redesigns, project delays, and stakeholder dissatisfaction. To address requirements imprecision, stakeholders must collaborate effectively to ensure that requirements are clear, complete, and aligned with the project's objectives. Requirements validation and verification processes should also be in place to ensure that the requirements are accurate, consistent, and feasible.

Requirements completeness and consistency are important aspects of developing an academic course registration system that meets stakeholder needs and expectations. 

Requirements completeness refers to the extent to which all necessary and relevant requirements for the system have been identified, documented, and validated. It is essential to ensure that all aspects of the system are covered by the requirements, and nothing important has been overlooked or omitted. Incomplete requirements can lead to system failure, budget overruns, and project delays.

In an academic course registration system, complete requirements may include functionality requirements such as course search, enrollment, and waitlisting, as well as non-functional requirements such as performance, security, and availability. Each requirement should be described in sufficient detail to ensure that it is fully understood by all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and end-users.

## Requirements Completeness and Consistency

Requirements consistency, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which the requirements are compatible with each other and do not contradict one another. Consistent requirements ensure that the system design is aligned with stakeholder expectations and that the system can meet its intended purpose. Inconsistent requirements can lead to confusion, errors, and poor system performance.

In an academic course registration system, consistent requirements might include ensuring that course enrollment limits are consistent with the physical capacity of classrooms or ensuring that faculty members are not assigned to teach courses that overlap in schedule.

To ensure requirements completeness and consistency, stakeholders should engage in continuous communication and collaboration throughout the development process. Requirements should be reviewed and validated regularly to ensure they remain accurate, complete, and consistent with the system's overall objectives. This can be achieved through techniques such as requirement traceability, which links each requirement to its source and verifies its implementation in the system.

## Goals and Requirements 

Here are some examples of goals and requirements in an academic course registration system:

Goal 1: Increase student satisfaction with the course registration process
Requirement: The system must provide an intuitive, easy-to-use interface that allows students to search for courses, add them to their schedule, and drop them if needed. The system must also provide clear instructions and guidance throughout the process.

Goal 2: Improve course availability and scheduling
Requirement: The system must be able to handle a high volume of course registrations, with real-time updates to course availability and scheduling. The system must also allow faculty to easily manage course schedules and make changes as needed.

Goal 3: Increase transparency and communication
Requirement: The system must provide clear and timely communication to students and faculty regarding course availability, registration deadlines, and other important information. The system must also provide tools for students and faculty to communicate with each other, such as messaging or discussion forums.

Goal 4: Ensure security and privacy of student data
Requirement: The system must adhere to strict security and privacy standards, with appropriate measures in place to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. The system must also comply with all relevant laws and regulations governing the storage and handling of student data.

Goal 5: Improve data analysis and reporting
Requirement: The system must provide robust data analysis and reporting capabilities, allowing administrators to track registration trends, course availability, and other key metrics. The system must also provide tools for generating reports and visualizations that are easy to understand and use.

These are just a few examples of the types of goals and requirements that might be important for an academic course registration system. By aligning the system design and development with these goals and requirements, stakeholders can ensure that the system meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff, and helps the university achieve its objectives.
