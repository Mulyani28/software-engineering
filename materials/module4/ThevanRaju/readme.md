# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Campus Management System

## Key steps in creating an Campus Management System
Developing an campus management system for a university involves several key steps:

### 1. System requirements gathering
The first step in developing a campus management system is to gather requirements from stakeholders such as students, faculty members, and university administrators. This involves identifying the key features and functionalities that are required for the system to meet the needs of these stakeholders. Some of the key requirements for a campus management system may include course catalog, course registration, scheduling, waitlist management, grade management, student information management, billing and financial management, library management, and hostel management. The requirements should be documented in a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

### 2. System design
Once the requirements are gathered, the next step is to design the system. This involves creating a high-level system architecture that outlines the different components of the system and how they interact with each other. The system design should also include a detailed database design that specifies the data models and relationships between different entities in the system. Finally, the user interface design should be created that defines how users will interact with the system.

### 3. System development
After the system design is finalized, the actual development of the system can begin. This involves writing code using programming languages, frameworks, and tools that are best suited for the requirements of the system. The development process should follow a structured approach that includes version control, code reviews, and testing at each stage of development.

### 4. System testing
Once the system is developed, it needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected. This involves conducting various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Testing should be done for all possible scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

### 5. System deployment
After the system is tested and approved, it needs to be deployed on the university's servers or cloud infrastructure. The deployment process should be carefully planned and executed to ensure minimal disruption to the normal operations of the university. Once the system is deployed, it should be closely monitored for performance and availability.

### 6. System maintenance
Finally, the system needs to be maintained and updated to ensure that it continues to meet the evolving needs of the university. This involves fixing bugs, adding new features, and making updates to the system to keep it up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. System maintenance should be done on a regular basis to ensure that the system remains reliable, secure, and efficient.
