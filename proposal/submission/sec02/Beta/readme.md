Overall, our food ordering system provides an efficient and reliable solution for customers to order food online and for restaurant owners to manage their business operations effectively

## 2. Background:
  The food industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, with more people opting for the convenience of online food ordering. With the rise of digital technologies and the increasing number of mobile devices, customers are looking for fast and easy ways to order food from their favorite restaurants.

Traditionally, ordering food required customers to visit a restaurant in person or call to place an order. This process was time-consuming and often resulted in errors in orders. Moreover, restaurants had to rely on manual processes to manage their orders and inventory, making it challenging to keep up with the demand.

The development of online food ordering systems has revolutionized the way people order food. Customers can now browse menus, select items, and pay for their orders online, making the process more convenient and efficient. Additionally, restaurant owners can manage their orders and inventory more efficiently, improving their overall business operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to the growth of the online food ordering industry, with many restaurants pivoting their business models to offer online ordering and delivery services. This has further accelerated the need for reliable and efficient food ordering systems.

Overall, the food ordering system is a solution that addresses the growing demand for online food ordering and provides a convenient and efficient way for customers to order food and for restaurant owners to manage their operations effectively.


## 3. Objectives:
  Our proposed **Food Ordering System** aims to achieve the following objectives:



## 4. Scope: 
The scope of a food ordering system can vary depending on the specific requirements of the system, but some common features and functionalities that can be included are:

- User Registration and Login : Users should be able to create their accounts and log in to the system using their credentials.

- Menu Management : The system should allow restaurant owners to manage their menu, including adding, updating, and deleting items.

- Order Placement : Customers should be able to browse the menu and place orders online, either takeaway or dine-in.

- Payment Processing : The system should provide a secure and efficient payment gateway that enables users to make payments online.

- Order Tracking : The system should allow customers to track their orders in real-time and provide status updates, such as order confirmed, preparing, on the way, and delivered.

- Feedback and Reviews : The system should allow customers to provide feedback and leave reviews for the restaurant and its dishes.

- Admin Panel : The system should have an admin panel that enables the restaurant owner to manage the entire system, including users, menu items, and orders.

- Mobile App : The system can have a mobile application that enables customers to place orders and track their orders on the go.

- Analytics and Reporting : The system can provide analytics and reporting tools that enable the restaurant owner to analyze their sales and make informed business decisions.

In summary, this food ordering system can streamline the entire food ordering process, from browsing the menu to payment processing and delivery, thereby enhancing the user experience and generating higher sales for the restaurant.
  
  

## 5. Software Process Model:

A planned and methodical approach to software development that provides high-quality, dependable, and maintainable software is what the software process model aims to achieve. It outlines the procedures, actions, and activities needed to create software, from gathering requirements to testing, releasing, and maintaining it.

The Agile methodology is the optimal development process paradigm for a food ordering system. This methodology focuses on providing a minimum viable product (MVP) during brief development cycles and is characterised by iterative and incremental development. It enables ongoing feedback and interaction between the development team and stakeholders, allowing the team to quickly adjust to shifting priorities and requirements.

The Agile methodology is perfect for this project because it guarantees timely delivery of a functional registration system while allowing for flexibility and response to stakeholder feedback. Additionally, it offers a framework for controlling project risks and guaranteeing that performance and quality are upheld throughout the development process.
  
The illustration of the Agile software process model that relates to this project is shown below:

1. Planning phase : In this phase, project goals are defined, stakeholders are identified, and the project's scope, objectives, and requirements are described. The tasks include creating the project charter, analysing the stakeholders, and obtaining the requirements. The project manager is in charge of supervising the operations throughout this two-week phase.

2. Design phase : In this phase, the development team designs the system architecture, database schema, and user interface. Database design, prototyping, and wireframing are among the tasks. The software architect is in charge of managing the tasks throughout this phase, which lasts for four weeks.

3. Development phase : Coding, unit testing, and integration testing are all part of this step. Coding, testing, and documentation are among the tasks. The development team lead is in charge of managing the activities throughout this six-week phase.

4. Testing phase : The development team tests for functionality, performance, and security throughout this stage. The activities include test preparation, test execution, and defect management. The QA lead is in charge of managing the tasks during this phase, which lasts for two weeks.

5. Deployment phase : During this phase, the registration system will be put into production and user acceptance testing will be carried out. The activities include user training, documentation, and system maintenance. The project manager is in charge of supervising the operations throughout this two-week phase.

This project will use functional, performance, and security testing approaches. Retrospectives, sprint planning, and daily stand-up meetings are all examples of project management techniques. Code reviews, automated testing, and user acceptability testing will all be included in quality assurance procedures.

In conclusion, the suggested meal ordering method is best suited to the Agile development process model. Its incremental and iterative methodology, along with efficient project management techniques and quality assurance procedures, will guarantee the prompt delivery of a dependable and high-quality food ordering system.


## 6. Budget:

The budget for developing a food ordering system can vary depending on several factors, such as the complexity of the system, the features and functionalities required, the development platform, and the development team's location and expertise. 

- System Design and Development : RM50,000.
  
This includes the cost of designing the system architecture, creating wireframes, and developing the system's front-end and back-end.

- Database Management : RM20,000.

This includes the cost of setting up and managing the database, including configuring security and backup systems.

- Payment Gateway Integration : RM20,000.

This includes the cost of integrating a payment gateway system into the food ordering system, enabling customers to make online payments.

- Mobile Application Development : If a mobile application is required, the cost can range from RM10,000 to RM50,000.

- Testing and Quality Assurance : RM20,000.

This includes the cost of testing the system for bugs and errors and ensuring that the system meets the quality standards.

It's essential to note that these are just estimates, and the actual cost may vary based on the specific requirements of the project. Additionally, ongoing maintenance costs and server hosting costs may also need to be considered.
