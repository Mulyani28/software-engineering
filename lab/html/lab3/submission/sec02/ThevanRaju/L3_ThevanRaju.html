		<h1><b><u>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1><b></u></b>

		<h3>Director Demands Investigation</h3> 

		<h5><i>Adapted from The Onion</i></h5>

		<p> LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages 
            of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

		<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink
         that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

		<p> CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, 
            such as: </p>
		    
		
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>* the Cold War</li>
            <li>* the civil-rights movement </li>
            <li>* the growth of the international drug trade</li>
          </ul>
