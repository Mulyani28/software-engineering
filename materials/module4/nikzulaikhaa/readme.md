# Software Requirements Document (SRD) : Parcel Delivery System

Developing a parcel delivery system that involves several key steps. This is a general outline of the steps:

### 1. Planning and Requirements Gathering: 

 Planning and requirements gathering are important steps in any project or initiative. These activities help to ensure that the project meets its goals, objectives, and stakeholder expectations. This is the process in which we will be identifying on who is the stakeholder, and gather informations including the functional and non-functional requirements, user requirements, system integration requirements and legal and regulatory requirements.

### 2. System Design: 

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is an important step as it helps to ensure that the system is designed to meet its intended purpose and is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.

### 3. System Development:

System development is the process of creating or modifying an information system, software application, or other technology solution to meet specified requirements. The development process typically involves several stages, including analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

### 4. User Acceptance Testing:

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing that is conducted to determine whether a system or application meets the requirements and expectations of its intended users. The objective of UAT is to ensure that the system is user-friendly, intuitive, and functions as expected in a real-world environment.


### 5. Deployment:

Deployment is the process of releasing a software application or system into a production environment, making it available for use by end-users. It involves a series of steps to ensure that the system is installed, configured, and tested correctly in the production environment.

### 6. Maintenance and Support:

Maintenance and support are ongoing activities that ensure that a software application or system continues to function correctly, remains up-to-date, and meets the changing needs of its users. Maintenance and support typically involves activities like monitoring for bugs and providing support to the users when needed.

### 7. System Evaluation:

System evaluation is the process of assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of a software application or system. The goal of system evaluation is to identify areas of the system that are performing well and areas that need improvement.

Overall, developing a Parcel Delivery System requires a strategic process that involves thorough planning, and tons of information gathering, system design and development, testing, deployment and being maintained and evaluated so that it meets the stakeholders expectation and achieve its goals.











## Requirement Engineering

Requirement engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing requirements for a software application or system. The goal of requirement engineering is to ensure that the software application or system meets the needs of its users and stakeholders.

### 1. Functional Requirements:

-	The system should allow the user to register the services by providing their informations.
-	The system should be able to track the parcel and let the user knows about their parcel whereabouts.
-	The system should show the delivery schedules so that the students can pick a convenient time and date for them.
-	The system should allow the users to schedule a package pickup at the designated parcel center.
-	The system should be able to allow users to choose options to pay for their parcels like by cash or online bankings and e-wallets.
-	The system should set the desired package size and weight limits received to ensure the safety of the parcel.
-	The system should have a specific procedure on handling the parcels whether it is a fragile parcel or not, to ensure the parcel received in good conditions.
-	The system should allow the user to provide feedbacks regarding the parcel center and its delivery services.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements:

-	The system should be able to handle a large request and data processing with reasonable time frame.
-	The system should be available with minimal downtime for maintenance.
-	The system should be reliable and with good security measures to ensure the protection of the users data.
-	The system should be able to fit with the growing number of users without affecting its performance.
-	The system should be easily accessible and should be compatible with various devices and platforms used by the users.
-	The system should be easy to maintain and comply with relevant regulations and standards.




## Goals

The goal of a parcel delivery system is to provide a fast, reliable, and efficient way to transport packages from one location to another. The primary objective of a parcel delivery system is to ensure that the package arrives at its intended destination safely and on time, while also providing transparency and visibility to customers throughout the delivery process.

By implementing a delivery service system, the university can enhance their reputation as a university that cares about their students’ whereabout and matters regarding the matter. The system can also help reduce factors like package theft, loss or damage. 

Additionally, this system can save time for university staff who would need to manage package deliveries manually. With the help of this system, the staff can ensure that their parcels are handled well and have one less burden off their chores.

Overall, the goal of a delivery service system for a university is to provide a convenient solution for packaging issues that meet the students, faculty and staff requirement, while maintaining the reputation of a university.
