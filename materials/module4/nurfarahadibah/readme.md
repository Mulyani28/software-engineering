# Software Requirements Document (SRD): College Room Rental System

Creating a college room rental system can be a complex project, but here are some key steps to consider:

#### Identify the requirements: 
Define the features and functionality of your college room rental system. For example, will it allow students to search for available rooms, reserve a room, pay for the reservation, or review past reservations?

#### Design the system architecture: 
Create a high-level architecture for your system, including the database structure, user interface design, and technology stack. Choose the appropriate programming language, database management system, and front-end framework.

#### Develop the backend: 
Develop the server-side of your system using the chosen technology stack. Implement the database schema, API endpoints, and server-side logic.

#### Develop the frontend: 
Develop the client-side of your system using a front-end framework. Implement the user interface design, user authentication, and client-side logic.

#### Test the system: 
Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the system functions correctly and is free from bugs and errors.

#### Deploy the system: 
Deploy the system to a production environment and configure it for scalability, reliability, and security.

#### Maintain the system: 
Continuously monitor the system and resolve any issues that arise. Provide support to users and make improvements and enhancements to the system as needed.

## Requirement engineering
Requirement engineering is an important phase in the development of any software system, including a college web room rental system. Here are some key steps you can take to get started:

#### 1.	Identify the stakeholders:
Determine who the key stakeholders are for the college web room rental system. This might include students, faculty, staff, and administrators.
####  2.	Gather requirements: 
Collect and document the requirements for the system. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other techniques. Make sure to consider the needs of all stakeholders and prioritize requirements based on their importance.
####  3.	Define system scope:
Define the scope of the system and its boundaries. Identify the key functions and features of the system and the user groups that will use it.
####  4.	Create use cases: 
Develop use cases that describe the interactions between users and the system. Use cases should include the steps users take to accomplish specific tasks within the system.
####  5.	Specify functional and non-functional requirements: 
Specify the functional requirements that the system must meet, such as the ability to search for available rooms and make reservations. Also, specify non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability.
#### 6.	Validate requirements: 
Validate the requirements with stakeholders to ensure that they accurately reflect their needs and expectations.
#### 7.	Document requirements: 
Document the requirements in a clear and concise way, using a format that can be easily understood by all stakeholders. Make sure to keep the requirements up-to-date as the project progresses.

By following these steps, you can create a solid foundation for the development of a college web room rental system that meets the needs of its users.

The system should incorporate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or fraud.
These are just a few potential user and system requirements for a college web room rental system. The actual requirements may vary depending on the specific needs of the college and its users.


## Functional Requirement
Functional requirements in a college web room rental service describe the specific features and functionalities that the system must have in order to meet the needs of its users. Here are some examples of functional requirements for a college web room rental service:

#### 1.	Room search: 
The system should allow users to search for available rooms based on criteria such as date, time, location, room size, and amenities.
#### 2.	Room booking: 
Users should be able to book a room for a specific date and time, with the option to choose additional services such as audiovisual equipment or catering.
#### 3.	Rental management: 
Users should be able to view their rental history, cancel or modify bookings, and request refunds.
#### 4.	Payment processing: 
The system should be able to process payments securely and efficiently, allowing users to pay for rentals using a variety of payment methods.
#### 5.	Room availability management: 
The system should maintain an accurate and up-to-date record of room availability, preventing double bookings and conflicts.
#### 6.	Email notifications: 
The system should send email notifications to users to confirm their booking, remind them of upcoming rentals, and provide rental receipts.
#### 7.	User authentication: 
The system should require users to create an account and authenticate their identity before they can make a reservation or view their rental history.
#### 8.	Reporting and analytics:
The system should generate reports and analytics to track usage patterns, revenue, and other key metrics.

Functional requirements define what the system should do and how it should behave in response to user inputs and actions. By defining these requirements, the system developers can ensure that the system meets the needs of its users and provides the desired level of functionality and usability.
