### 1. Executive Summary:
Our proposed KTDI Event Management System is a comprehensive solution that aims to simplify and streamline the processes of event management for Jawatankuasa Kolej Mahasiswa Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (JKM KTDI) at University Technology Malaysia (UTM), KTDI office staff, and fellow KTDI.

Our system offers a range of key features that assist our stakeholders in event preparation and post-activity processes. One such key feature is the inclusion of a calendar for annual events. This feature enables JKM KTDI to plan and schedule their events for the year in advance, avoiding scheduling conflicts. Another feature is the ability to handle the necessary documents for each activity, ensuring that all required paperwork is organised and easily accessible.

Additionally, our system enables JKM KTDI to distribute tasks to team members, allowing for efficient delegation and a smoother planning process. With our system's visible progress feature, event planners can track their team’s progress and stay on top of their goals throughout the planning process. Lastly, after the event is over, allow them to complete their activity with post-event reporting.

Overall, our system is designed to make event planning and execution as seamless as possible, allowing JKM KTDI to focus on delivering a successful event.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid gray;height:0.5px;">

### 2. Background:
Events are an essential part of the Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) college. However, the current process of event preparation and post-activity processes is time-consuming and less-productive. The KTDI Event Management System is designed to solve the problems and inconveniences faced by stakeholders in activity preparation and improve the effectiveness of event preparation. 

One of the issues faced by stakeholders is the problem of event dates crashing, which occurs due to the manual event preparation process. Our proposed system addresses this challenge by introducing a calendar for annual events. This feature enables JKM KTDI to plan and schedule their events for the year in advance, avoiding scheduling conflicts and allowing for the allocation of resources accordingly. With the calendar for annual events, JKM KTDI can quickly identify which dates are already reserved and which are available, making it easier to plan and organise events in a systematic manner.

The stakeholders are required to go through a laborious process of seeking approval from multiple parties through paperwork. For instance, the KTDI Student Residential College Committee (JKM KTDI) has to manually fill in the program approval form to reserve locations and facilities in KTDI, followed by obtaining approvals from the program director, fellow KTDI, and KTDI principal, and finally submitting the proposal to Student Affairs. Our system aims to simplify this process by managing all necessary documents for each activity with just a click of the mouse. By using a paperless method, the system can promote environmental protection and prevent the loss or destruction of physical documents.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid gray;height:0.5px;">

### 3. Objectives:
#### Specific: 
* To digitise and automate the paperwork process for JKM’s event planning and project management within KTDI.

<hr style="border:0.5px solid gray;height:0.5px;">

### 5. Software Process Model:
The <b>Agile software development process model</b> is the ideal software process model for this KTDI event management system development. The Agile process model is an adaptable and iterative method of developing software that places a focus on teamwork, client satisfaction, and the quick delivery of functional software. This process model emphasises delivering value to the user (JKM) at each iteration and is appropriate for projects with varying requirements and uncertainties.

The Agile process model was chosen because it enables frequent feedback and changes to be made to the software while it is being developed. Since this system is being created for a university, it is likely that the requirements will change and be updated as the project moves forward. The Agile process model is well suited to handle such changes and still deliver a high-quality product on time.

The Agile process model consists of the following phases:

#### 1. Planning Phase: 
During this stage, the project manager will establish the project's scope, objectives, and goals, while taking into account the requirements of the stakeholders. The team will create a product backlog that prioritises the system's features or requirements, and defines the milestones, deadlines, and checkpoints. This will ensure that the project stays on track and within the set timeline.

#### 2. Design Phase:
The team will create the system's architecture, data models, user interfaces, and user experience during this phase. In order to obtain feedback from the stakeholders and make sure that the design meets their needs, the user experience designer will also create a mockup or prototype of the system. To ensure that the system design is feasible and meets the project's goals, it will be thoroughly reviewed and documented.

#### 3. Development Phase:
The team will begin coding and integrating the various system components during this phase. The main developer will keep an eye on the process and guarantee that the code complies with the standards and guidelines established by the project. The team will collaborate, and the code will be frequently checked to make sure it performs as expected. Throughout this phase, testing will be done to find any flaws and make sure the code complies with project requirements.

#### 4. Testing Phase:
Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing are a few of the tests the system will go through at this stage. To make sure the system follows the requirements and operates as intended, the main developer will test the system. The team will conduct user acceptance testing in conjunction with stakeholders to ensure that the system meets users' needs and expectations.

#### 5. Deployment Phase: 
The main developer will deploy the system to the production environment during this phase, making it accessible to the users (JKM KTDI and KTDI college office staff and fellow members). The system will undergo final testing and validation to make sure it is ready for use. To ensure the system is successfully adopted, users and support personnel will receive training, and any required documentation will be made available.

#### 6. Maintenance Phase
The team will ensure the system's upkeep and maintenance during this phase, including bug fixes, software updates, and any necessary improvements. The objective is to maintain the system's smooth operation and adapt to the users' changing needs. The team will carry out routine assessments to make sure the system keeps up with the project's goals and stakeholder expectations.

### Testing Methodologies: 
The testing methodologies that will be used are black-box testing, white-box testing, and grey-box testing.

* <b>Black-box testing</b>:
Also referred to as functional testing or behavioural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is unaware of the internal workings of the system being tested. The tester in this method only has access to the system's inputs and outputs, and they test the system's functionality in accordance with its specifications and requirements. In the case of the KTDI event management system, the end-users such as JKM KTDI, KTDI college office staff, and fellow members will conduct this kind of testing.

* <b>White-box testing </b>:
Also known as structural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is aware of how the system being tested operates on the inside. This approach involves running tests on the system's internal components, such as code or algorithms, to make sure they work as intended. Developers or testers with access to the source code of the system being tested usually carry out white-box testing. In the KTDI event management system, the team members will perform this type of testing.

* <b>System testing:</b> For KTDI event management system, system testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions as expected. This can involve testing various aspects of the system, including the user interface, location booking system, paperwork management processes, and other key features. System testing helps to identify any bugs, errors, or issues that may impact the system's functionality, and ensures that the system is reliable and performs well under different scenarios. The team members will carry out system testing for the KTDI event management system.

* <b>Performance testing:</b> This test focuses on assessing how well the system performs under various loads and stresses. It is beneficial to locate any performance problems or bottlenecks that could be affecting the stability, scalability, and responsiveness of the system. Performance testing for the KTDI event management system will involve creating realistic scenarios to test the system's throughput, response time, and resource usage under various user activity levels. A variety of metrics, including server response time, page load time, and network latency, will be measured during this testing using specialised tools and software. The system's performance will be optimised, any performance problems will be found, and the system's ability to handle the anticipated workload will be confirmed using the performance testing results. The team members are in charge of testing the KTDI event management system's performance.

### Project Management Practices: 
* <b>Agile Project Management:</b>  An effective project management strategy for software development projects is called agile. It entails segmenting the project into shorter, easier-to-manage units called sprints. A specific set of tasks are finished during each sprint, which is a brief, concentrated time frame.

* <b>Scrum:</b> Scrum is an agile project management framework for software development. It includes a number of rituals, roles, and artefacts that aid in making sure the project is completed on schedule, within budget, and in accordance with the necessary quality standards.

* <b>Daily Stand-up Meetings:</b> Daily stand-up meetings are quick, focused gatherings that occur each day. Team members share updates on their progress, discuss any difficulties they are having, and mention any dependencies they may have on other team members during these meetings.

* <b>Sprint Planning:</b> Each sprint starts with a planning session known as”sprint planning”. The team reviews the backlog of work, chooses which tasks to include in the sprint, and determines how long it will take to complete each task during this meeting.

* <b>Sprint Review:</b> The team holds a sprint review meeting at the end of each sprint. The team presents the work that has been completed during the sprint during this meeting, and stakeholders provide feedback.

* <b>Retrospective Meetings:</b> The team holds a review session following each sprint. The team reviews the sprint during this meeting and pinpoints areas for development.


### Quality Assurance Processes: 
* <b>Testing Activities:</b> A crucial component of quality assurance is testing. By carrying out various testing tasks like black-box testing, white-box testing, and system testing, it will guarantee that the system complies with the quality standards . The purpose of the testing operations is to find any flaws or problems in the system and make sure it satisfies the demands of the stakeholders.

* <b>Test Reports:</b> The documentation specialist will also be responsible for creating test reports. These reports will summarise any issues found and include the testing activities' findings. The reports will be used to monitor the testing's progress and make sure the system is upholding the necessary quality standards.

* <b>Unit Testing:</b> The main developer and team members will also perform unit testing. Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves testing individual units or components of the system in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of the system is working as intended and that there are no defects or errors in the code.

* <b>Code Reviews:</b> In addition to unit testing, the main developer and team members will also perform code reviews. Code reviews are a software quality assurance activity in which one or more developers review the code written by another developer. The purpose of code reviews is to identify defects or errors in the code and to ensure that the code is consistent with the project's coding standards and guidelines.

* <b>Continuous Integration:</b> Developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository as part of the software development practice known as continuous integration. Continuous integration's goal is to guarantee that the code is properly integrated and that any problems or conflicts are quickly found and fixed. Additionally, continuous integration contributes to ensuring that the system operates as intended and complies with the necessary quality standards.

### 7. System Architecture:
The proposed system architecture for the KTDI event management system is a web-based system built using modern technologies and frameworks. The system will have a multi-tier architecture consisting of a presentation layer and  application layer. The presentation layer will be responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. The application layer will be responsible for implementing the business logic of the system and handling user requests. The system will require users to enter their email and password to gain access, limiting use to JKM KTDI members, staff of the office KTDI, fellows, and assistant fellows.

The system will have two interfaces catering to different roles: the JKM interface and the Staff Office KTDI and Fellow interface. JKM members will be able to create spaces for handling the necessary documents for each activity. Within these spaces, they can distribute tasks to different members, and progress is visible to all members, staff, fellows, and assistant fellows involved.

Users can upload their event-related documents to the system, and a feature allows them to send the documents to the appropriate approver. The person in charge can decide whether to approve the documents or not. If the approval is rejected, one can leave comment for improvement and correction at the comment section

JKM members can use this system to record completed activities for record-keeping purposes. This may include generating reports for each unit and feedback reports that can serve as a reference for future JKM batches, fellows, and assistant fellows.

The Staff Office KTDI, Fellow, and Assistant Fellow interfaces can view whether there are any documents that need approval and check the progress of each unit of the activity. They can also access the report and record section to view past activities that have been organised.

Quality Assurance and Testing Procedures

- Automated Unit Testing: Code will be tested automatically by a unit testing framework during the development phase to ensure that individual units of code work correctly.
- Manual System Testing: After the front-end and back-end of the system are developed, a quality assurance analyst will perform manual system testing to ensure that the system works correctly as a whole.
- User Acceptance Testing: End users will perform testing on the system to ensure that it meets their requirements and expectations.
- Bug Fixing: Any issues or bugs found during testing will be addressed by the development team and retested before being deployed.

### 12. Conclusion:
By addressing the issue of managing and improving the effectiveness of the paperwork of co-curricular activities in Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (KTDI) college, the suggested system seeks to boost the usability and effectiveness of the previous system.

One of the key features of converting from a manual to fully digital system is that it will be accessible to only the authorised personnel specifically JKM KTDI, KTDI office staffs and KTDI fellow members only. This implementation will contribute to saving the earth because less paper is used and less time is spent travelling, waiting, and getting feedback from higher authorities.

The two user interfaces, one for JKM KTDI and the other for fellow KTDI employees and office workers. According to their individual roles and responsibilities, each user will have a unique set of features and capabilities. For instance, JKM KTDI will be able to use the system to send proposals and related documents to the KTDI office staff and other members, check the status of approval, monitor the progress of each unit for each event, reserve the venue, and update and upload post-event reports for record purposes to refer to for each session. They will also be required to compile an annual report of all the events held during that year. In order to prepare for the future event, the KTDI office staff and other members will be able to approve applications and documents, sign documents electronically, and track the development of each unit.

Additionally, the new system will give every user a high level of customization and flexibility. This will allow them to set deadlines, assign tasks, and upload documents. To keep users engaged and informed on relevant material, the system will also include notifications, reminders, and feedback systems.

Overall, the new system is a considerable advance over the manual paperwork approach since it offers users at all levels of the higher KTDI authorities members greater accessibility, functionality, and customization.
