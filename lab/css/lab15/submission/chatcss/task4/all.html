            <p>
               Pop superstar Taylor Swift has scored another record-breaking achievement with the release of her latest
               album,
               "Fearless (Taylor's Version)," which has debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album, which is a
               re-recording of Swift's 2008 album "Fearless," features newly recorded versions of all 13 original
               tracks, as
               well as six previously unreleased songs. Swift's loyal fan base has been eagerly anticipating the release
               of the album,
               which is seen as a way for the artist to regain control of her music catalog after a public dispute with
               her former record
               label. The success of "Fearless (Taylor's Version)" is a testament to Swift's enduring popularity and
               influence in the music industry.

            <h2><a>Biden Administration proposes $2 trillion infrastructure plan to Congress</a>
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
               President Joe Biden's administration has unveiled a sweeping infrastructure proposal worth $2 trillion
               that aims
               to rebuild and modernize America's aging infrastructure while creating millions of jobs. The plan
               includes
               investments in transportation, water systems, broadband internet, and affordable housing, as well as
               measures
               to address climate change and improve public health. The proposal is expected to face significant
               opposition
               from Republicans in Congress, who argue that it is too expensive and includes provisions unrelated to
               infrastructure.
               However, Democrats have signaled their support for the plan, which they see as a crucial step towards
               creating a more
               equitable and sustainable future for all Americans.
