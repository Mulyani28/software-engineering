Software Requirements Document (SRD): Academic Advisor System
Key steps in creating an Academic Advisor System
Developing an academic advisor system for a university involves several key steps:

1. Define the system's requirements
Identify the needs of the lecturers and students, and determine what features the system should have. This might include a calendar, a meeting website, a messaging system, and more.

2. Develop a system design
Based on the requirements, design the system's architecture, modules, components, and interfaces. Make sure to include the necessary security features and data privacy measures.

3. Choose the appropriate technology stack
Select the technologies and tools that are most appropriate for the system's development, such as programming languages, frameworks, and databases.

4. Develop the system
Implement the system design by writing code, configuring the hardware and software, and integrating components. Ensure that you test the system at each stage of development to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as intended.

5. Implement the calendar feature
Develop a calendar feature that allows lecturers and students to schedule meetings, set reminders, and view upcoming events. This feature should also allow them to view other users' calendars and share their own.

6. Implement the meeting website feature
Develop a website that allows lecturers and students to join meetings, view past recordings, and download lecture materials. This feature should also allow them to schedule and manage meetings.

7. Implement other features
Based on the requirements, implement other features such as messaging, document sharing, and grading tools.

8. Test the system
Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure that the system functions as intended and meets the requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

9. Deploy the system
Once the system has been tested and validated, deploy it to the target environment.

10. Maintain and support the system
After deployment, maintain and support the system by monitoring its performance, fixing bugs, and adding new features as needed.

11. Review and improve the system
Periodically review the system to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the users and the organization. Use feedback to identify areas for improvement and make changes as necessary.
