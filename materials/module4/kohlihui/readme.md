# Requirement Engineering Process

The Requirement Engineering Process of an event management system involves several steps, which are as follows:

### 1. Elicitation: This is the first step in the requirement engineering process, where the requirements of the system are gathered. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, or other techniques to understand the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

### 2. Analysis: In this step, the requirements gathered in the elicitation phase are analyzed to identify any inconsistencies or conflicts, and to prioritize the requirements based on their importance.

### 3. Specification: The requirements identified in the analysis phase are then documented in a clear and concise manner. This documentation may include use cases, user stories, or other types of specifications.

### 4. Validation: In this step, the documented requirements are reviewed by stakeholders and experts to ensure they are accurate, complete, and meet the needs of the users.

### 5. Verification: In the verification phase, the requirements are checked against the actual implementation of the system to ensure they have been implemented correctly.

### 6. Maintenance: Once the system is in use, any changes or updates to the requirements must be managed through a maintenance process. This may include updating the documentation, testing the changes, and ensuring they are properly implemented in the system.

Throughout the requirement engineering process, it is important to maintain open communication with stakeholders and to prioritize their needs and expectations. By following these steps, the development team can ensure that the event management system meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders, and delivers a valuable solution to meet the needs of event organizers and attendees.


# User and System Requirement in Event Management System

In an event management system, there are both system requirements and user requirements that need to be considered. 

## System requirements refer to the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Functional requirements are the specific features and functions that the system must perform, while non-functional requirements define how the system should perform in terms of usability, reliability, security, performance, and other factors.

#### Here are some examples of system requirements for an event management system:

- The system must provide an online registration and ticketing platform.
- The system must allow event organizers to create and manage the event schedule.
- The system must provide tools for event marketing and promotion.
- The system must provide analytics and reporting features to help organizers track attendance, ticket sales, revenue, and other key metrics.
- The system must be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access.

## User requirements refer to the needs and expectations of the users of the system, such as event organizers, attendees, and vendors. These requirements may include specific features or functions that the users need to perform their tasks effectively and efficiently.

#### Here are some examples of user requirements for an event management system:

- Event organizers need an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing events.
- Attendees need an easy-to-use registration process and access to event details, including the schedule and location.
- Vendors need an easy-to-use interface for registering and managing their vendor information and payments.
- Event attendees need an easy-to-use check-in process at the event.

In order to design and develop an effective event management system, it is important to consider both system requirements and user requirements. By understanding the needs and expectations of the users and ensuring that the system meets the functional and non-functional requirements, the system can provide a valuable solution to event organizers and attendees.

# Functional requirement in an Event Management System

Overall, functional requirements in an event management system should focus on providing an easy-to-use, comprehensive platform that meets the needs of all stakeholders involved in the event. By considering these functional requirements, the event management system can provide a valuable solution that enhances the event experience for all involved.


# Non-functional requirement in an Event Management System

Non-functional requirements in an event management system refer to the system's performance, usability, and other qualities that are important but are not directly related to the system's functionality. 

#### Here are some examples of non-functional requirements in an event management system:

### 1. Performance: 
- The system must be able to handle a high volume of traffic and transactions without slowing down or crashing. This includes requirements for response time, throughput, and scalability.

### 2. Security: 
- The system must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data and transactions. This includes requirements for data encryption, access controls, and disaster recovery.

### 3. Usability: 
- The system must be intuitive and easy to use for all stakeholders, including event organizers, attendees, vendors, and sponsors. This includes requirements for user interface design, user training, and accessibility.

### 4. Reliability: 
- The system must be reliable and available at all times, without any unplanned downtime. This includes requirements for system uptime, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.
