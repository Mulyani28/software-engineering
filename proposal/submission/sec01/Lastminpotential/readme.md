### 2. Background:
The Faculty of Computing is a leading academic institution that is committed to providing high-quality education and support to its students, faculty, and staff. To ensure continuous improvement and maintain its reputation as a top educational institution, the faculty recognizes the importance of gathering feedback from its stakeholders.

However, traditional methods of collecting feedback, such as paper-based surveys and face-to-face interactions, are time-consuming and can result in incomplete or inaccurate data. As a result, there is a need for a more efficient and effective feedback collection system that can provide timely and relevant information to the faculty.

To address this need, the Faculty of Computing proposes the development of a comprehensive feedback management system. The Faculty of Computing Feedback System will be a user-friendly platform that will simplify and streamline the feedback collection process for students, faculty, and staff.

The proposed system will enable users to provide feedback quickly and easily on a range of topics, including teaching quality, course content, facilities, and administrative support. This will help the faculty identify areas for improvement, make data-driven decisions, and allocate resources more effectively. The system will also allow the faculty to monitor feedback in real-time and respond to issues quickly, improving the overall quality of education and services provided.

The Faculty of Computing Feedback System will provide measurable benefits to all stakeholders, resulting in increased student satisfaction, better engagement and participation, and a stronger institutional reputation. By investing in this system, the faculty will be at the forefront of feedback management technology and innovation, leading to continuous improvement and meeting the evolving needs of its stakeholders.
