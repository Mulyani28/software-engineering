### 2. Background:
The Faculty of Computing is a leading academic institution that is committed to providing high-quality education and support to its students, faculty, and staff. To ensure continuous improvement and maintain its reputation as a top educational institution, the faculty recognizes the importance of gathering feedback from its stakeholders.

However, traditional methods of collecting feedback, such as paper-based surveys and face-to-face interactions, are time-consuming and can result in incomplete or inaccurate data. As a result, there is a need for a more efficient and effective feedback collection system that can provide timely and relevant information to the faculty.

To address this need, the Faculty of Computing proposes the development of a comprehensive feedback management system. The Faculty of Computing Feedback System will be a user-friendly platform that will simplify and streamline the feedback collection process for students, faculty, and staff.

The proposed system will enable users to provide feedback quickly and easily on a range of topics, including teaching quality, course content, facilities, and administrative support. This will help the faculty identify areas for improvement, make data-driven decisions, and allocate resources more effectively. The system will also allow the faculty to monitor feedback in real-time and respond to issues quickly, improving the overall quality of education and services provided.

The Faculty of Computing Feedback System will provide measurable benefits to all stakeholders, resulting in increased student satisfaction, better engagement and participation, and a stronger institutional reputation. By investing in this system, the faculty will be at the forefront of feedback management technology and innovation, leading to continuous improvement and meeting the evolving needs of its stakeholders.

    <ul>
      <li>The feedback system can be used to collect feedback on the teaching quality of lecturers. Students can provide feedback on the clarity of lectures, the effectiveness of teaching methods, and the overall engagement of the lecturer.</li>
      <li>This feedback can be used to identify areas where a lecturer may need additional support or training, or to recognize outstanding lecturers who are making a positive impact on students' learning experiences.</li>
      <li>It is important to ensure that feedback is constructive and focused on improving the quality of education, rather than being personal or derogatory towards lecturers.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Facilities Feedback:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The feedback system can be used to collect feedback on the quality of facilities, such as classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and other learning spaces.</li>
      <li>Students can provide feedback on the cleanliness, safety, and accessibility of facilities, as well as the availability of resources and equipment.</li>
      <li>This feedback can be used to identify areas where facilities may need improvement or maintenance, and to prioritize resources accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Equipment Feedback</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The feedback system can be used to collect feedback on the quality and availability of equipment, such as computers, projectors, and other technology used in the classroom.</li>
      <li>Students can provide feedback on the functionality and reliability of equipment, as well as the availability of support resources.</li>
      <li>This feedback can be used to identify areas where equipment may need maintenance or replacement, and to ensure that students have access to the resources they need to succeed.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

It is important to remember that the system's implementation can run into potential restrictions or obstacles, such reluctance to change or technological issues. But we have taken steps to lessen these difficulties and make sure the implementation goes smoothly.However, concerns about data privacy and system integration could surface as the system is being developed.Although there are some challenges, the system's benefits outweigh these disadvantages, so we advise the customer to accept the proposal and continue with the project.

Therefore, we implore the decision-makers to act and accept the proposal to move the project forward.The staff of Computing Feedback System will modernise the feedback process, improving educational quality and fostering greater staff and student satisfaction.  For the duration of the implementation process, we are devoted to offering resources and support to make sure it is successful.In the end, the Faculty of Computing Feedback System will help the faculty succeed overall by improving the standard of instruction, the learning environment, and fostering ongoing programme improvement.
