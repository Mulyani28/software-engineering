## The Issue
Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users, process requests quickly, and provide a responsive user interface.

Reliability: The system should be highly reliable, with minimal downtime and data loss, to ensure uninterrupted availability of services.

Security: The system should have robust security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.


Scalability: The system should be scalable to accommodate future growth in terms of users, data, and functionalities, without significant performance degradation.

Usability: The system should be easy to use, with a user-friendly interface, clear navigation, and intuitive workflows, to minimize training requirements and improve user adoption.

Accessibility: The system should be accessible to users with disabilities, conforming to relevant accessibility standards and guidelines.

Data Integrity: The system should ensure data integrity, accuracy, and consistency through appropriate data validation, verification, and backup mechanisms.

Integration: The system should support integration with other relevant university systems, such as student information systems, financial systems, and learning management systems, to enable seamless data exchange and workflow integration.

Compliance: The system should comply with relevant laws, regulations, and policies, such as data privacy regulations, copyright laws, and institutional policies related to academic and administrative processes.

## The requirements engineering process

Requirement Elicitation: This step involves gathering requirements from various stakeholders, such as university administrators, faculty, staff, students, and other users of the system. Techniques such as interviews, surveys, questionnaires, workshops, and brainstorming sessions can be used to elicit requirements. The goal is to capture the needs and expectations of the stakeholders and understand the scope and objectives of the University Management System (UMS).


Requirement Analysis: Once the requirements are elicited, they need to be analyzed to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and feasible. This step involves identifying any ambiguities, conflicts, or gaps in the requirements, and clarifying them with the stakeholders. It may also involve prioritizing requirements based on their importance, feasibility, and potential impact on the system.


Requirement Specification: In this step, the requirements are documented in a clear and concise manner using appropriate techniques, such as use cases, user stories, or formal requirement documents. The requirements should be written in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders, and they should be traceable to their sources, such as specific stakeholders or business processes.


Requirement Validation: Once the requirements are documented, they need to be validated to ensure their accuracy, consistency, and alignment with the stakeholders' needs and expectations. This step involves reviewing the requirements with the stakeholders, conducting reviews, inspections, or walkthroughs, and using techniques such as requirement verification, validation, and testing to identify and fix any issues or errors in the requirements.


Requirement Management: Requirements are likely to change during the development and implementation of the University Management System. This step involves managing changes to requirements, tracking their status, and ensuring that they are properly documented and communicated to all stakeholders. It may also involve maintaining a requirements traceability matrix to track the relationships between requirements and other system artifacts, such as design documents, test cases, and user manuals.


Requirement Documentation: Finally, the requirements need to be documented in a comprehensive and organized manner, so that they can serve as a reference for the development team, stakeholders, and other users of the system. This documentation should include all the requirements, their associated attributes (such as priority, status, and owner), and any supporting information, such as use cases, user stories, or diagrams, to provide a complete and clear understanding of the system's requirements.


Requirement Review and Approval: Once the requirements are documented, reviewed, and validated, they need to be approved by relevant stakeholders, such as university administrators, faculty, and staff. This step involves obtaining formal sign-off or approval on the requirements, indicating that they are accurate, complete, and acceptable to all stakeholders, and can serve as the basis for the development and implementation of the University Management System.

## Stakeholders

University Administrators: They are responsible for overseeing the overall operations of the university, including the management of administrative processes and systems. They may have requirements related to efficient management of university resources, reporting and analytics, financial management, and overall system performance.


Faculty and Staff: They are responsible for various academic and administrative processes within the university, such as student enrollment, course management, grading, and scheduling. They may have requirements related to ease of use, efficiency, and accuracy of these processes to support their daily activities.


Students: They are the end-users of the UMS and may have requirements related to online registration, course enrollment, access to grades and transcripts, communication with faculty and staff, and other academic activities. They may also have expectations related to user-friendly interfaces, accessibility, and ease of use.


IT Department: They are responsible for managing the IT infrastructure, networks, and systems within the university. They may have requirements related to system integration, security, scalability, and performance of the UMS to ensure its smooth operation within the existing IT environment.


Financial Department: They are responsible for managing the financial aspects of the university, such as budgeting, financial reporting, and billing. They may have requirements related to financial management, reporting, and integration with financial systems for accurate financial tracking and reporting.


External Stakeholders: There may be external stakeholders, such as regulatory bodies, accreditation agencies, vendors, and other partners, who have requirements related to compliance, data privacy, and integration with their systems.


Alumni and Donors: They may have requirements related to alumni engagement, fundraising, and donation management within the UMS.


Government and Regulatory Bodies: They may have requirements related to compliance with laws, regulations, and policies related to education, data privacy, and financial management.
