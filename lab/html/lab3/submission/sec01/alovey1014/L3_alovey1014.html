	<p><span style="font-size:20">LANGLEY, VA—</span> A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector
		General revealed that the CIA has
		mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
	</p>

	<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by
		an
		indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
		began at
		the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

	<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b><sup>[1]</sup> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the
		particulars of several
		historic events, such as:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:20px">
		<li style="margin-left:20px">Cold War</li>
		<li style="margin-left:20px">the civil-rights movement </li>
		<li style="margin-left:20px">the growth of the international drug trade</li>
	</ul>
