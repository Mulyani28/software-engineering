# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management System

 Key steps involved in creating a student health and wellness management system: 

## 1.System Requirements Gathering:
The first step in creating any system is to gather requirements from stakeholders. In this case, the stakeholders would be students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators. You can conduct interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather requirements from these stakeholders. Some of the requirements for a student health and wellness management system may include the ability to track health records, schedule appointments, and receive reminders for upcoming appointments.

## 2.System Design:
Once you have gathered the requirements, the next step is to design the system. You will need to create a detailed system architecture that outlines the various components of the system and how they will interact with each other. This will include designing the user interface, the database schema, and the backend server.

## 3.System Development:
After the system design is complete, the next step is to develop the system. You will need to hire a team of developers to build the system according to the design. You will also need to test the system to ensure that it is working as intended. During the development process, you should also focus on making the system user-friendly and easy to use.

## 4.System Deployment:
Once the system has been developed and tested, the next step is to deploy it. This will involve installing the system on servers and configuring it to work with the school's existing IT infrastructure. You will also need to train school staff and students on how to use the system.

## 5.System Maintenance:
The final step is to maintain the system. This will involve fixing bugs, adding new features, and ensuring that the system is running smoothly. You will also need to keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against cyber attacks.

<br/>
Overall, creating a student health and wellness management system requires careful planning, design, development, deployment, and maintenance. It is important to involve stakeholders throughout the process to ensure that the system meets their needs and is user-friendly.
