# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Grading System

Designing a university student grading system requires careful consideration of various factors. Here are the key steps that need to be taken to create an effective student grading system:

# 1. System Requirement Gathering:
a. Identify stakeholders: Identify key stakeholders, such as students, faculty, and administrators, and understand their needs and expectations.
b. Define requirements: Define the grading policies, grading scales, and weightage of each grade component. Determine the grade calculation formulas, grade rounding rules, and grade release policies.

# 2. System Design:
a. Develop the database: Create a database to store all the relevant data, such as student records, course information, and grading components. Ensure the database supports efficient data retrieval, storage, and processing.

b. Create user interfaces: Design user-friendly interfaces for faculty and administrators to enter grades and for students to view their grades. The interfaces should be designed to support various grading functions, such as grade entry, grade calculation, and grade release.

c. Integrate with other systems: The grading system should be integrated with other systems used by the university, such as the student information system and the learning management system. This will ensure seamless data exchange and reduce the need for duplicate data entry.

d. Develop grading rules and policies: Develop grading rules and policies to ensure consistency and fairness in grading. This includes guidelines for handling grade appeals, grade corrections, and grade confidentiality.

# 3. System Development:
a. Develop the grading system: Using the requirements and design, develop the grading system, including database schema, user interface design, integration with other systems, and grading rules and policies.

b. Test the system: Test the system thoroughly to ensure that it meets the grading system requirements and functions correctly. This includes testing the user interfaces, database, and system integration.

# 4. System Implementation:
a. Launch the system: After testing, the grading system can be launched. Communicate the launch of the system to all stakeholders and provide training to users to ensure that they can use the system effectively.

# 5. System Maintenance:
a. Monitor and maintain the system: The grading system needs to be monitored and maintained to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the users. This includes monitoring system performance, addressing user feedback, and making updates and improvements as needed.

These steps will help you create an effective university student grading system that meets the needs of faculty, administrators, and students, while ensuring consistency and fairness in grading.


# Requirements engineering

Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. Here are the key steps involved in the requirements engineering process for a university student grading system:

# 1. Elicitation of requirements: 
In this step, you need to identify the stakeholders involved in the grading system, such as students, faculty, and administrators. You need to understand their needs and expectations regarding the grading system. You can conduct interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather their requirements.

# 2. Analysis of requirements: 
In this step, you need to analyze the requirements gathered in the previous step to identify the key features and functionalities needed in the grading system. You need to prioritize the requirements based on their importance and feasibility.

# 3. Specification of requirements: 
In this step, you need to specify the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner. You can use various techniques, such as use cases, user stories, and requirements documentation, to specify the requirements.

# 4. Validation of requirements: 
In this step, you need to validate the requirements to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and correct. You can conduct reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections to validate the requirements.

# 5. Management of requirements: 
In this step, you need to manage the requirements throughout the software development life cycle. You need to track changes to the requirements, manage requirements traceability, and ensure that the requirements are met in the final product.

When eliciting the requirements for a university student grading system, you need to consider various factors, such as the grading policies, grading scales, and weightage of each grade component. You also need to determine the grade calculation formulas, grade rounding rules, and grade release policies. Additionally, you need to consider the user interface design, integration with other systems, and grading rules and policies.

In summary, requirements engineering is a crucial process in the development of a university student grading system. It ensures that the grading system meets the needs of all stakeholders and functions as intended.
