        <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
            mistakenly
            obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred
            by an
            indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
            began at the
            agency's inception in 1947.</p>

        CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
        several historic
        events, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
