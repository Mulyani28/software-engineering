## Requirements to creating an online student grading system

When developing an online student grading system for a university, it's important to consider the specific requirements of the institution and stakeholders involved. Here are some common requirements to consider:

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization

The system should have secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users, such as faculty and staff, can access and input grades. This may involve username and password authentication, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control to restrict access to different system features based on user roles.

### 2. Grade Input and Management

The system should allow faculty to easily input and manage student grades. This may include features such as the ability to input grades for different assignments, exams, and other assessments, calculate weighted grades, handle special cases (e.g., incomplete grades), and update grades as needed.

### 3. Grade Calculation and GPA Calculation

The system should be able to calculate grades and calculate the overall Grade Point Average (GPA) for each student based on the grading policy and scale used by the university. This may involve implementing algorithms for grade calculation, considering factors such as weighted grades, percentage scores, and other criteria.

### 4. Reporting and Analytics

The system should provide reporting and analytics features that allow faculty and administrators to generate reports and analyze student performance. This may include features such as grade distribution analysis, class performance reports, and individual student performance reports.

### 5. Exception Handling

The system should have the ability to handle exceptions, such as incomplete grades, deferred exams, and other exceptional cases. This may involve implementing workflows and notifications for handling exceptions, as well as providing a mechanism for students to request grade changes or updates.

### 6. Security and Data Privacy

The system should have appropriate security measures in place to protect student data and ensure data privacy. This may include data encryption, secure storage of data, regular backups, and compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or FERPA.

### 7. User-friendly Interface

The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use for both faculty and students. This may involve designing intuitive user interfaces with clear instructions, responsive design for different devices, and accessibility features for users with disabilities.

### 8. Integration with Existing Systems

The system should integrate with other existing university systems, such as the student information system (SIS) or learning management system (LMS), to ensure seamless data flow and reduce duplication of data entry.

### 9. Scalability and Performance

The system should be scalable and able to handle a large number of concurrent users and data entries. It should also be optimized for performance to ensure smooth and efficient operation even during peak usage times.

### 10. Support and Maintenance

The system should have provisions for ongoing support and maintenance, including regular updates, bug fixes, and technical support to ensure smooth operation and address any issues that may arise.

## Stakeholders
