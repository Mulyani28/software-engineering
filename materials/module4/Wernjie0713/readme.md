# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Feedback System UTM

<h2>Introduction:</h2> Start with an introduction to the topic of student feedback in universities. Explain why it's important, what the current situation is like, and why there is a need for a new or improved system.

<h2>Objectives:</h2> Clearly state the objectives of your proposed feedback system. What do you hope to achieve? What problems do you want to solve? What benefits will the system provide for students, teachers, and the university as a whole?

<h2>System design:</h2> Describe the design of your proposed feedback system. This could include the format of the feedback, the questions you want to ask, the platform you want to use, the frequency of the feedback, and so on. Be as detailed as possible.

<h2>Benefits:</h2> Explain the benefits of your proposed feedback system. These could include improved student engagement, better student-teacher communication, more effective teaching, and improved academic outcomes. You could also discuss how the feedback system will help the university in terms of institutional effectiveness, quality assurance, and accreditation.

<h2>Implementation plan:</h2> Outline the steps that will be required to implement the feedback system. This could include obtaining approval from university administrators, piloting the system with a small group of students and teachers, refining the system based on feedback, and rolling it out to the wider university community.

<h2>Evaluation:</h2> Explain how you will evaluate the success of the feedback system. What metrics will you use to measure the effectiveness of the system? How will you ensure that the feedback is being used to make positive changes in the university?

<h2>Conclusion:</h2> Sum up your proposal and restate the importance of having a student feedback system in universities. Emphasize the benefits and potential positive impact that the system could have on students, teachers, and the university as a whole.

<h2>Requirement Engineering Process</h2>
<b>1.Requirements Elicitation:</b> The process of gathering and discovering requirements from stakeholders. This can be done through interviews, surveys, workshops, focus groups, and other techniques.
<br><br>
<b>2.Requirements Analysis:</b> Analyzing the requirements to understand their scope, feasibility, and impact. This includes identifying stakeholders, prioritizing requirements, and resolving any conflicts.
<br><br>
<b>3.Requirements Specification:</b> Documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner. This includes creating use cases, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and other specifications.
<br><br>
<b>4.Requirements Validation:</b> Ensuring that the requirements are complete, accurate, and consistent. This includes reviewing the requirements with stakeholders, testing them, and validating them against business objectives and constraints.
<br><br>
<b>5.Requirements Management:</b> Managing changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle. This includes tracking changes, ensuring traceability, and maintaining the requirements baseline.
<br><br>
<b>6.Requirements Communication:</b> Communicating the requirements to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. This includes creating documentation, presentations, and other communication materials to convey the requirements and their impact.
<br><br>
<b>7.Requirements Traceability:</b> Ensuring that the requirements are traceable from the original stakeholder requirements through to the final product. This includes linking requirements to design, development, and testing artifacts.
<br><br>
<b>8.Requirements Prioritization:</b> Prioritizing requirements based on business value, risk, and impact. This includes creating a requirements traceability matrix, identifying critical requirements, and managing requirements dependencies.
<br><br>
<b>9.Requirements Verification:</b> Verifying that the requirements have been implemented correctly. This includes testing the product against the requirements, reviewing the code, and verifying that the product meets the stakeholder requirements.
<br><br>
<b>10.Requirements Maintenance:</b> Maintaining the requirements throughout the product lifecycle. This includes updating the requirements as changes occur, ensuring that the requirements are still relevant, and ensuring that they meet the needs of the stakeholders.
