            <span class="bold">T</span>he history of technical education in this country has been a century
            old. It all began in 1904 when a Technical School began its operation on
            Weld Road (now Jalan Raja Chulan) to teach Technical Assistants for the
            Federated Malay States Departments of Railways, Survey and Public Works.

            <span class="bold">T</span>he school was officially known as Treacher Technical School, named
            after Sir William Treacher, the Resident General during that time.
            Students followed classed on part-time basis; they worked and trained
            specifically according to the technical needs of their employment.
        </p>
        <p class="green">
            <span class="bold">D</span>epartment In 1941, the Advisory Committee of Technical Schools and the
            Education recommended that the Technical School be elevated to a college
            status and proposed that a new Technical College be constructed. The new
            college was to be built on a 47-acre piece of Government land in Gurney
            Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the construction of
            the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in
            Peninsular Malaysia.
