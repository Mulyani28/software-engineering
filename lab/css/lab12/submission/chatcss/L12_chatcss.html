        in Jalan Semarak within Kuala Lumpur, with an area of 38 hectares.[9] The branch campus <br>
        accomodate diploma students, part-time students (also known as the SPACE program), <br>

            teach Technical Assistants for the Federated Malay States Department of Railways, Survey

            recommended that the Technical School be elevated to a college status and proposed that a <br>
            new Technical College he constructed. The new college was to be built on a 47-acre piece of <br>
            Government land in Gurney Road (now Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Plans for the <br>
            construction of the college, however, were put on hold when World War II erupted in <br>
            Peninsular Malaysia.
