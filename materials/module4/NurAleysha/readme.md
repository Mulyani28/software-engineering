# Software Requirements Document (SRD): College Room Rental System

Creating a college room rental system can be a complex project, but here are some key steps to consider:

#### Identify the requirements: 
Define the features and functionality of your college room rental system. For example, will it allow students to search for available rooms, reserve a room, pay for the reservation, or review past reservations?

#### 1. Design the system architecture: 
Create a high-level architecture for your system, including the database structure, user interface design, and technology stack. Choose the appropriate programming language, database management system, and front-end framework.

#### 2. Develop the backend: 
Develop the server-side of your system using the chosen technology stack. Implement the database schema, API endpoints, and server-side logic.

#### 3. Develop the frontend: 
Develop the client-side of your system using a front-end framework. Implement the user interface design, user authentication, and client-side logic.

#### 4. Test the system: 
Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the system functions correctly and is free from bugs and errors.

#### 5. Deploy the system: 
Deploy the system to a production environment and configure it for scalability, reliability, and security.

#### 6. Maintain the system: 
Continuously monitor the system and resolve any issues that arise. Provide support to users and make improvements and enhancements to the system as needed.

## The requirements engineering process for a college room rental system involves the following steps:

### 1. Requirements elicitation: 
Identify stakeholders who will use or be affected by the college room rental system, and gather information about their needs and expectations. This can be done through interviews, surveys, or workshops with students, staff, and administrators.

### 2. Requirements analysis: 
Analyze the information collected during requirements elicitation to identify common themes and define the functional and non-functional requirements of the college room rental system. This includes defining the types of rooms that need to be rented, the information that needs to be captured for each rental, the workflows and processes involved in managing room rentals, and any integration requirements with other systems such as payment gateways or room inventory management.

### 3. Requirements specification: 
Document the requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous way. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as use cases, user stories, or requirements lists.

### 4. Requirements validation: 
Validate the requirements by checking that they meet the needs of the stakeholders, are complete, consistent, and feasible. This can be done through reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.

### 5. Requirements management: 
Manage changes to the requirements throughout the development and maintenance of the college room rental system. This involves tracking requirements changes, assessing the impact of changes on the system, and ensuring that the requirements remain valid and up-to-date.

### 6. Requirements traceability: 
Establish traceability between the requirements and the various artifacts produced during the development and maintenance of the college room rental system. This includes tracing requirements to design, implementation, testing, and maintenance activities, as well as to other requirements and system documentation.

By following these steps, the requirements engineering process can help ensure that the college room rental system meets the needs of stakeholders, is of high quality, and is delivered on time and within budget.
