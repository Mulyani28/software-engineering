### Table of Contents
- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
  
### 1. Executive Summary
- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Background:
- The introduction should provide background information about the software project and the purpose of the proposal. 
- It should also briefly describe the problem the software is meant to solve, the benefits it will provide, and its potential impact on the organization.

### 3. Objectives:
#### Specific: 
To provide a user-friendly system for students to explore, sign up for, and provide feedback on campus events, including club activities and official university events.

#### Measurable: 
To increase student engagement and participation in campus events by 20% within the first year of system implementation, as measured by the number of event registrations and attendance.

#### Achievable: 
To develop and launch the initial version of the system within two months, and to continually improve and update the system based on user feedback.

#### Relevant: 
To address the problem of limited access and awareness of campus events, and to enhance the overall student experience by providing an efficient platform for event planning, organisation, and participation.

#### Time-Bound: 
To complete the aforementioned goals within the upcoming two months and keep track of and continuously assess the system's effectiveness and impact.

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
A software process model's main objective is to offer a framework for the systematic and organised development of software. It offers a collection of tasks, products, and deadlines to make sure the software is created quickly and effectively. A software process model's main objective is to make sure that the software is high-quality, delivered on time, and within budget while also meeting the requirements of the stakeholders.

The <b>Agile software development process model<b> is the ideal software process model for this campus event management system development. The Agile process model is an adaptable and iterative method of developing software that places a focus on teamwork, client satisfaction, and the quick delivery of functional software. This process model emphasises delivering value to the customer at each iteration and is appropriate for projects with varying requirements and uncertainties.

The Agile process model was chosen because it enables frequent feedback and changes to be made to the software while it is being developed. Since this system is being created for a university, it is likely that the requirements will change and be updated as the project moves forward. The Agile process model is well suited to handle such changes and still deliver a high-quality product on time.

The Agile process model consists of the following phases:

#### 1. Planning Phase: 
During this stage, the team establishes the project's scope, objectives, and goals. A product backlog, which is a prioritised list of the system's features or requirements, is also created by the team.

#### 2. Analysis Phase:
The requirement analyst team works in conjunction with the stakeholders during this phase to compile and assess the system requirements. The group then develops user stories, which are concise, controllable chunks of functionality that can be worked on iteratively.

#### 3. Design Phase:
The team will develop a thorough system design, complete with user interfaces, data models, and system architecture, during this phase. The team will also develop a mockup or prototype of the system so that stakeholders can give input and verify that the design satisfies their requirements.

#### 4. Implementation Phase:
The team will start coding the system and integrating the various components throughout this phase. To make sure that the code is functioning as expected and that the system is meeting the project requirements, this phase calls for frequent testing and teamwork.

#### 5. Testing Phase:
During this stage, the team will test the system to make sure it complies with the specifications and performs as anticipated. System testing, integration testing, and unit testing are all included in this. To make sure the system satisfies users' needs and expectations, the team will also collaborate with stakeholders to carry out user acceptance testing.

#### 6. Deployment Phase:
In this phase, the team will deploy the system to the production environment and make it available to users. This includes final testing and validation, as well as training for users and support staff.

#### 7. Maintenance Phase:
The team will continue to support and maintain the system during this phase, including bug fixes, updates, and improvements.

#### Testing Methodologies: 
-The quality assurance analyst will use various testing methodologies such as black-box testing, white-box testing, and grey-box testing.
##### i. Black-box testing:
Also referred to as functional testing or behavioural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is unaware of the internal workings of the system being tested. The tester in this method only has access to the system's inputs and outputs, and they test the system's functionality in accordance with its specifications and requirements. In our case, the system's end users (students) will conduct this kind of testing.

##### ii. White-box testing
Also known as structural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is aware of how the system being tested operates on the inside. This approach involves running tests on the system's internal components, such as code or algorithms, to make sure they work as intended. Developers or testers with access to the source code (the team members) of the system being tested usually carry out white-box testing.

##### iii. Grey-box testing:
With this approach, the tester is only partially aware of how the system being tested operates internally. This enables them to test the system's functionality and internal structures to make sure everything is operating as it should. Grey-box testing is typically carried out by testers who have some familiarity with the inner workings of the system but not enough to carry out thorough white-box testing. In this case, it will be the IT administrator staff.


#### Project Management Practices: 
We can use Agile project management practices such as Scrum to manage the project. The team can have daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospective meetings.

#### Quality Assurance Processes: 
The quality assurance analyst along with the team members will ensure that the system meets the quality standards by performing various testing activities and creating test reports. The main developer and developer assistant will also perform unit testing and code reviews to ensure the quality of the code.


### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
- The risk assessment section identifies and assesses any potential risks that could impact the project, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or changes in project requirements. 
- It should also describe the plans and strategies to mitigate those risks.

### 9. Resources:
- Provide a detailed breakdown of the resources required for the proposed project, including staff, equipment, software, and other expenses.

### 10. Technical Specifications:
