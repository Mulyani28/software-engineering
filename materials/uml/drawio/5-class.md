# Class Diagrams


A class diagram in UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a type of static structure diagram that represents the structure of a system by showing the classes of objects, their attributes and methods, and the relationships among the classes.

In a class diagram, classes are represented as rectangles with the class name written in the top section. The attributes of the class are listed in the middle section, while the methods of the class are listed in the bottom section. Attributes represent the properties or characteristics of the class, such as the name, age, or address of a person, and methods represent the behaviors or actions that the class can perform, such as walking, talking, or eating.

Relationships between classes are represented by lines that connect the classes, with arrows indicating the direction of the relationship. There are several types of relationships that can be represented in a class diagram, including:

| Relationship | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Association | Represents a relationship between two classes where one class uses an instance of the other class. |
| Aggregation | Represents a relationship between two classes where one class is a part of the other class. |
| Composition | Represents a relationship between two classes where one class is composed of the other class. |
| Inheritance | Represents a relationship between two classes where one class is a subclass of the other class, inheriting its attributes and methods. |
| Dependency | Represents a relationship between two classes where one class depends on the other class. |

Class diagrams are useful for analyzing and designing complex systems, as they provide a visual representation of the system's structure and relationships. They are often used in software development to model the classes and relationships in an object-oriented program.
