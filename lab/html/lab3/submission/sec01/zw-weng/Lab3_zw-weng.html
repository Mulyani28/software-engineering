	<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
		mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
	</p>

	<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— <i>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"</i>—are marred by
		an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
		began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

	<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
		several historic events, such as:

	<ul>
		<li> the Cold War</li>
		<li> the civil-rights movement</li>
		<li> the growth of the international drug trade</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
