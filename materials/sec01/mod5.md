### Contents:
#### Notes
- [Requirements Analysis and Modeling ME](#requirement-analysis-and-modeling-me)

### Others
- [What Is Requirements Analysis and Modelling?](https://techcanvass.com/blogs/requirements-analysis-and-modelling.aspx)


## Overview

This module provides an overview of the requirements analysis and modeling process in software development. Students will learn the principles of requirements analysis, techniques for requirements elicitation, and tools for requirements modeling. Students will also gain an understanding of how to validate, prioritize, and manage requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the importance of requirements analysis in software development
- Apply techniques for eliciting requirements from stakeholders
- Use tools for modeling requirements, such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams
- Validate and prioritize requirements based on stakeholder needs and constraints
- Manage changes in requirements throughout the software development lifecycle
