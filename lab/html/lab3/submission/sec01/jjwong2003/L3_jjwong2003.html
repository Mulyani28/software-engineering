	<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
		mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
	</p>

	<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by
		an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
		began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

	<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
		several historic events, such as: </p>

	<ol>*the Cold War</ol>
	<ol>*the civil-rights movement</ol>
	<ol>*the growth of the international drug trade</ol>
