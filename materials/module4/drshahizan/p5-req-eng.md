# Part 5: Requirements Engineering 

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. The IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) is a standard document that specifies the requirements for a software system in a clear and concise manner.

The following are the generic activities that are common to all requirements engineering processes:

| Generic Activities  | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Requirements elicitation | Gathering requirements from stakeholders by identifying their needs and documenting their requirements. |
| Requirements analysis | Analyzing and refining the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. |
| Requirements validation | Verifying that the requirements meet the needs of stakeholders by checking if they are feasible, testable, and traceable. |
| Requirements management | Organizing and controlling the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle by identifying changes, tracking their status, and ensuring proper documentation and communication. | 


The process of creating an SRD for an academic course registration system. The following are the steps involved in creating an SRD:

1. Identify the stakeholders: In this step, we need to identify the stakeholders of the academic course registration system. These stakeholders may include students, faculty, administrators, and staff.

2. Elicit the requirements: In this step, we need to gather the requirements from the stakeholders. We can use techniques such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups to elicit the requirements.

3. Analyze the requirements: In this step, we need to analyze and refine the requirements that have been elicited. We should ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.

4. Validate the requirements: In this step, we need to verify that the requirements meet the needs of the stakeholders. We should ensure that the requirements are feasible, testable, and traceable.

5. Document the requirements: In this step, we need to document the requirements in the form of an SRD. The SRD should be clear and concise, and it should include all the requirements that have been elicited, analyzed, and validated.

6. Manage the requirements: In this step, we need to organize and control the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. We should identify changes to the requirements, track their status, and ensure that they are properly documented and communicated to stakeholders.

In conclusion, the process of requirements engineering is crucial in the development of software systems. By following the generic activities of requirements elicitation, analysis, validation, and management, and by creating an SRD for an academic course registration system, we can ensure that the requirements are clear, concise, and meet the needs of the stakeholders.

## Requirements elicitation and analysis

Requirements elicitation and analysis are two important stages of the requirements engineering process that are critical to the success of a software development project. 

Sure, here is a table that summarizes the generic activities of requirements engineering:

| Generic Activities  | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Requirements elicitation | Gathering requirements from stakeholders by identifying their needs and documenting their requirements. |
| Requirements analysis | Analyzing and refining the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. |
| Requirements validation | Verifying that the requirements meet the needs of stakeholders by checking if they are feasible, testable, and traceable. |
| Requirements management | Organizing and controlling the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle by identifying changes, tracking their status, and ensuring proper documentation and communication. | 

The following are some of the techniques used for requirements elicitation and analysis:

1. **Interviews**: One-on-one interviews with stakeholders can be used to gather information about their needs and requirements. This technique allows for a more in-depth understanding of the stakeholder's perspective.

2. **Surveys**: Surveys can be used to gather information from a large number of stakeholders. This technique is useful when the stakeholders are geographically dispersed.

3. **Focus groups**: Focus groups involve bringing together a group of stakeholders to discuss their needs and requirements. This technique allows for the exchange of ideas and can lead to new insights.

4. **Observations**: Observations involve observing stakeholders as they interact with the current system or perform their work. This technique can provide valuable insights into the stakeholders' needs and requirements.

5. **Prototyping**: Prototyping involves creating a working model of the software system. This technique can be used to gather feedback from stakeholders and refine the requirements.

6. **Use case analysis**: Use cases are scenarios that describe how the software system will be used. Use case analysis involves identifying the actors, defining the use cases, and specifying the interactions between the actors and the system.

In conclusion, requirements elicitation and analysis are crucial stages of the requirements engineering process. By using various techniques such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, observations, and prototyping, we can gather and analyze requirements to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. By doing so, we can increase the chances of delivering a software system that meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

## The stages of requirements elicitation and analysis

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Requirements discovery | Conduct interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observations to gather requirements from stakeholders such as students, faculty, and staff. Identify the stakeholders' needs and expectations for the course registration system. |
| Requirements classification and organization | Classify the requirements into categories such as functional, non-functional, and performance requirements. Organize the requirements into a requirements document that is easy to read and understand. |
| Requirements prioritization and negotiation | Prioritize the requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the feasibility of implementing them. Negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between conflicting requirements. |
| Requirements specification | Specify the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner. Use techniques such as use case analysis and prototyping to refine the requirements. |

### 1. The requirements discovery stage

| Requirements Discovery | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Interviews | Conduct one-on-one interviews with students, faculty, and staff to gather information about their needs and expectations for the course registration system. Ask open-ended questions to encourage stakeholders to provide detailed feedback. |
| Surveys | Send out a survey to all students, faculty, and staff to gather feedback on the current course registration system and suggestions for improvement. |
| Focus groups | Bring together groups of students, faculty, and staff to discuss their needs and expectations for the course registration system. Encourage stakeholders to share their experiences and provide feedback on the current system. |
| Observations | Observe students, faculty, and staff as they use the current course registration system. Identify pain points and areas where the system could be improved. |

### 2. Tthe requirements classification and organization stage

| Requirements Classification and Organization | Description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Functional requirements | Specify the system functions that are required such as registering for courses, dropping courses, and viewing course schedules. |
| Non-functional requirements | Specify the system attributes such as usability, performance, and reliability. |
| Performance requirements | Specify the system response times, throughput, and resource utilization. |
| Requirements document | Organize the requirements into a document that is easy to read and understand. Include sections such as introduction, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and performance requirements. |

### 3. The requirements prioritization and negotiation stage

| Requirements Prioritization and Negotiation | Description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Prioritization | Prioritize the requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the feasibility of implementing them. Use techniques such as MoSCoW prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize the requirements. |
| Negotiation | Negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between conflicting requirements. Use techniques such as compromise and problem-solving to reach agreements. |

### 4. The requirements specification stage

| Requirements Specification | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Use case analysis | Identify the actors (students, faculty, staff) and use cases (register for a course, drop a course, view course schedule) for the course registration system. Specify the interactions between the actors and the system. |
| Prototyping | Develop a prototype of the course registration system to gather feedback from stakeholders and refine the requirements. |
| Requirements document | Specify the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner in the requirements document. Use techniques such as functional decomposition to break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable requirements. |

During the requirements elicitation and analysis process, it's important to involve all relevant stakeholders and to gather as much information as possible about their needs and expectations for the system. This will help ensure that the final system meets the requirements of all stakeholders and is therefore more likely to be successful. It's also important to document the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner, using techniques such as use case analysis and prototyping to refine the requirements over time. This will help ensure that the requirements are well-understood by all stakeholders and that they can be used as a basis for designing and implementing the system. Finally, it's important to prioritize the requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the feasibility of implementing them, and to negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between conflicting requirements.

## Problems of Requirements Elicitation

Requirements elicitation is a complex process that involves gathering information from multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives and goals. As a result, there are several challenges that can arise during the requirements elicitation process, including:

A table summarizing the problems of requirements elicitation in the context of an academic course registration system:

| Problem | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ambiguity | Requirements may be unclear, incomplete, or open to interpretation, making it difficult to determine what is actually needed. |
| Incomplete or changing requirements | Stakeholders may not fully understand their needs or may change their requirements over time, making it difficult to finalize requirements. |
| Communication barriers | Stakeholders may have different backgrounds, expertise, or priorities, which can make it difficult to communicate effectively and understand each other's needs. |
| Stakeholder conflicts | Stakeholders may have conflicting requirements or priorities, which can be difficult to resolve and may require negotiation and compromise. |
| Lack of user involvement | Users may not be fully engaged in the requirements elicitation process, which can result in requirements that don't fully address their needs or are difficult to use. |
| Technical constraints | There may be technical constraints that limit the feasibility or practicality of certain requirements, making it difficult to implement them. |

To address these challenges, it's important to have a structured and iterative approach to requirements elicitation that involves ongoing communication and collaboration with stakeholders. Techniques such as prototyping, use case analysis, and stakeholder interviews can help to clarify requirements and ensure that they are well-understood by all stakeholders. It's also important to prioritize requirements and negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between competing requirements.

## Requirements discovery

Requirements discovery is the process of identifying and gathering information about the requirements for the academic course registration system. This stage involves eliciting requirements from various sources to ensure that all stakeholders' needs are captured accurately.

During the requirements discovery phase, it is important to conduct thorough research and analysis to ensure that all requirements are captured accurately. This can involve conducting interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other forms of communication to gather information from stakeholders. Once the information has been collected, it must be analyzed, classified, and organized to ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.

| Source of Information | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation | Existing documentation related to the system, such as user manuals, technical specifications, and other relevant documents can provide valuable insights into the system's functionality, limitations, and constraints. This information can be used to identify existing features and requirements that need to be improved or updated. |
| System Stakeholders | Individuals or groups who have a stake in the academic course registration system, including users, administrators, and developers, can provide valuable feedback on their requirements and expectations. Stakeholders can be interviewed or surveyed to identify their needs and preferences, and their feedback can be used to shape the system's requirements. |
| Specification from Similar Systems | Requirements or specifications from other course registration systems that are similar to the one being developed can provide valuable information on what has worked in the past and what changes may need to be made to suit the specific needs of this system. By analyzing similar systems, developers can identify common features and requirements that can be used to inform the development of the new system. |

The requirements discovery phase is critical to the success of the academic course registration system development project, and it is essential to involve all stakeholders in the process to ensure that their needs are met.
